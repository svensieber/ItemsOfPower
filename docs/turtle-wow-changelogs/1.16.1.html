    Abyssal Council |  High Council Bosses Changes<br>
    <br>
    High Council bosses will now always drop a random enchantment blue item and an epic item whenever killed instead of only one item that was randomly a blue or epic, practically doubling the number of items dropped. Old items have seen some slight buffs to make them more worthwhile:<br>

    <ul><li>Elemental Focus Band: Increased spell power from 22 to 24</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Earthern Guard: Armor buffed from 2468 to 2575, Block buffed from 44 to 47, added 1% Block chance.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Windshear Cape: Increased Strength from 8 to 10, added 1% Haste.</li></ul>

    Four new epics have been added to the High Council loot tables, one for each boss. Drop chance is equal to the old epic drops, being a 50% chance for both in the same loot table.<br>

    <ul><li>Skaldrenox's Rage: A flaming polearm that has a chance to blast your opponent for 205 to 245 Fire damage. 64.6 DPS</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Tempest's Rage: A stormy one-handed sword that has a chance to increase your attack speed by 15% for 20 seconds. 49.7 DPS</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Pearl of the Tides: A misty trinket that increases spell power by 32 and mana regen by 6 every 5 seconds.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Blackstone Crown: A stone-hewn mail helmet with 473 Armor, 10 Strength, 15 Agility, 34 Stamina and 1% Dodge chance.</li></ul>

    <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/class_changes/turtlewow_classchange_druid.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
    <br>
    The vanilla design of the Druid is infamous for being pretty unfinished. Its mechanics weren’t fully realized until well into the first expansion. Because of this, there’s a lot of freedom on how to improve on the class while sticking with the “vanilla feeling.” That said, simply attempting to recreate the druid of later expansions is a cop-out, but we feel incorporating some iconic and fan-favorite abilities would be a good idea.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#8dc63f">Talent Changes</span></strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Balance</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Natural Weapons</span> | Now 3 Ranks (down from 5)<br>
    Increases the damage you deal with physically in all forms by <strong class="text-strong">3/6/10% and increases your chance to hit with melee attacks and spells by 1/2/3%.</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Nature's Grace</span><br>
    All spell criticals grace you with a blessing of nature, reducing the casting time<strong class="text-strong"> and global cooldown</strong> of your next spell by 0.5 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Moonkin Form</span><br>
    Transforms the Druid into Moonkin Form. While in this form the armor contribution from items is increased by 360%, <strong class="text-strong">the Mana cost of your Balance spells reduced by 20%,</strong> and all party members within 30 yards have their spell critical chance increased by 3%.  The Moonkin can only cast Balance spells, <strong class="text-strong">Innervate, and Remove Curse</strong> while shapeshifted.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Omen of Clarity</span><br>
    Imbues the Druid with natural energy. Each of the Druid's melee attacks and direct damage spell casts has a chance of causing the caster to enter a Clearcasting state. The Clearcasting state reduces the Mana, Rage, or Energy cost of your next damage or healing spell or offensive ability by 100%. Lasts 30 min. <br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Feral</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Primal Fury</span> and <span style="color:#FFB019">Blood Frenzy</span> have had their existing effects combined into <span style="color:#FFB019">Primal Fury</span>: Gives you a 50/100% chance to gain an additional 5 Rage anytime you get a critical strike while in Bear and Dire Bear Form and your critical strikes from Cat Form abilities that add combo points have a 50/100% chance to add an additional combo point.<br>
    <br>
    Reduced the ranks of <span style="color:#FFB019">Thick Hide</span> from 5 ranks to 3 ranks.<br>
    Increases your Armor contribution from items by <strong class="text-strong">3/6/10%.</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Feral Instinct</span> reduced from 5 ranks to 3 ranks.<br>
    Increasing threat caused in Bear Form and Dire Bear Form by <strong class="text-strong">5/10/15%</strong> and reduces the chance enemies have to detect you while PRowling. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">New Talent:</span> <span style="color:#FFB019">Blood Frenzy</span> (Row 4) | 2 Ranks<br>
    Increases the duration of Tiger's Fury by 3/6 seconds and your Enrage now also instantly restores 5/10 rage. In addition, Tiger’s Fury and Enrage increases your attack speed by 6/12% for 6/12 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">New Talent:</span> <span style="color:#FFB019">Berserk</span> (Row 5) | 6 Minute Cooldown<br>
    Removes all Fear effects and increases your energy regeneration rate by 100% while in Cat form, and increases your total health by 20% while in Bear Form. After the effect ends, the health is lost. The effect lasts 20 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Restoration</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Swiftmend</span> has moved from a Row 7 to a Row 3 talent, replacing Insect Swarm.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Tranquil Spirit</span> is no longer a prerequisite for the Row 7 major talent.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Improved Rejuvenation</span> is now a prerequisite talent for Improved Regrowth.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Improved Enrage</span> has been removed from the Restoration tree and has been integrated into the new talent Blood Frenzy.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Subtlety</span> now also reduces threat generated from Balance spells.<br>
    Reduces the threat generated by your Healing <strong class="text-strong">and Balance</strong> spell<strong class="text-strong">s</strong> by 4/8/12/16/20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">New Talent: </span><span style="color:#FFB019">Tree of Life Form</span> (Row 7)<br>
    Shapeshift into the Tree of Life. While in this form you increase healing received by 20% of your total Spirit for all party members within 30 yards, your movement speed is reduced by 20%, and you cannot cast damaging spells or Healing Touch, but the mana cost of these spells is reduced by 20%. <br>
    <br>
    The act of shapeshifting frees the caster of Polymorph and Movement Impairing effects.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/class_changes/turtlewow_classchange_hunter.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
    <br>
    Hunter’s main problem in vanilla comes down to two issues: DPS does not scale well with their gear so they tend to not be competitive in endgame stages, and their pets are particularly fragile in a raid setting, often leading to them not being used. Burning Crusade fixed these problems at the same time with pet scaling, Kill Command, and Steady Shot abilities - leading them to become massively overpowered. Avoiding this while also addressing their vanilla issues can be done by not giving them all three at once.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#8dc63f">New Abilities</span></strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Trueshot</span><br>
    A precise shot with a ranged weapon that strikes the target for X additional damage. (Cooldown of this ability is equal to the attack speed of your ranged weapon.)<br>
    Rank 1: 10 Additional Damage, 5% Mana, Learned at Level 36<br>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Aspect of the Wolf</span><br>
    Learned at Level 30 | Toggled | 185 Mana Cost |<br>
    The hunter takes on the aspects of a wolf, increasing melee attack power by 155 and disabling the use of ranged attacks. Only one Aspect can be active at a time.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Avoidance</span><br>
    Learned at Level 50 | Pet Passive |<br>
    Reduces the damage your pet takes from the area of effect attacks by an additional 50%.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Beast Mastery</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Improved Eyes of the Beast</span><br>
    Increases the duration of Eyes of the Beast by 30/60 seconds. While channeling this ability your tamed pet deals 15/30% additional damage and increases its focus generation by 15/30%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Improved Aspect of the Hawk</span> has been renamed to <span style="color:#FFB019">Improved Predator Aspects</span> and now gives your melee attacks a 1/2/3/4/5% chance to increase melee attack speed by 30% for 12 seconds while Aspect of the Wolf is active.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Survival</strong><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">New Talent: Superior Strikes</span><br>
    Reduces the cooldown of your Raptor Strike and Mongoose Bite by 0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">Monster Slaying</span> and <span style="color:#FFB019">Humanoid Slaying</span> have been combined into one talent called <span style="color:#FFB019">Improved Slaying</span> which gives the damage and critical damage bonuses of both talents. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/class_changes/turtlewow_classchange_mage.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
    <br>
    There isn’t much to improve on for the Fire and Frost mage specs in vanilla - they are tightly designed and synergize well with other mages very well. That said, Arcane falls far behind despite having an opportunity to fill its own niche and the possibility of encouraging the Elemental Mage playstyle.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#8dc63f">Changes to Baseline Spells</span></strong><br>

    Increases the critical strike damage bonus of your Arcane spells by 18/36/50%. Requires Arcane Mind as a prerequisite talent.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFB019">New Talent: </span><span style="color:#FFB019">Brilliance Aura</span> (Row 5)<br>
    Gives Mana regeneration to party members equal to 15% of the Mage's mana regeneration within 30 yards. Lasts 30 minutes. Requires Arcane Potency as a prerequisite talent. (Can be cast while riding a mount, just like how the Archmage did in Warcraft 3.)<br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/class_changes/turtlewow_classchange_paladin.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
    <br>
    Let’s be frank - the only good thing a paladin can do in vanilla is healing. Sure, with the right setup you can do decent tanking or decent DPS, but it still doesn’t all quite come together. A lot of the potential and uniqueness to the class has always attracted people to it, but that was progressively lost over time in retail post-vanilla. We believe there is a lot of opportunities to help the Paladin perform more than just healing adequately without making them too powerful or “warrior-lite.”<br>

    <span style="color:#FFB019">Crusader Strike</span><br>
    A strike that causes X damage and increases the holy damage taken by the target by up to Y per Crusader Strike. Can be applied up to 5 times. Lasts 30 seconds.<br>

    Shadow priests are notorious for being good, but also not. Their mana economy is horrendous and comes with several downsides other dps+caster hybrids don’t have to work around. The challenge for Shadow is to boost its utility and mana economy without increasing its power, as their damage per second is actually very good already.<br>

    Not a lot to say for Rogues. If anything, Combat being the only viable talent spec in PvE all the way to late AQ40/Naxx is unfortunate. Debuff cap limits and some new abilities to add to their toolkit without majorly changing the way the class functions is something we believe Rogue players are looking for.<br>

    PvE is the only area where Warlock has an issue - they’re boring! A class with as much cool stuff in its toolkit should not have to be limited to just spamming Shadowbolt exclusively. Debuff cap discussion aside, there are definitely ways to expand on the class fantasy of the Warlock in addition to addressing its singular issue. Something to also take into consideration for the future is that the Warlock talent trees went virtually untouched through the course of development through Burning Crusade. Also, similar to the Hunter, the Warlock’s demons are too vulnerable in raid settings with large amounts of AoE damage.<br>

    Warrior in Vanilla is overpowered. Just straight up too powerful for the game. That being said, this just means that any change made to the class must down one of two things only: either optimize what doesn’t work but should for the class, or improve on suboptimal playstyles to allow for more options for the player. The changes proposed for the coming patch attempt to stick within those guidelines. <br>
