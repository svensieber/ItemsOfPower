<div class="content">We are thrilled to announce that development of our upcoming patch, <strong class="text-strong">Beyond The Greymane Wall</strong>, is now complete and we are about to enter the testing phase! Once we ensure that everything is working as planned, we will announce the release date :) As expected, the patch turned out to be much bigger than we initially anticipated, even larger than Mysteries of Azeroth. Therefore, we have decided to shift the build number to 1.17.0! Please take a moment to read our final changelog!<br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">SPELL CHANGES</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Note: We are opening recruitment for the Class Design this August!<br>

    <ul><li>The arsenal of Mage transportation has seen some additions, allowing Mages to teleport or open portals to Theramore and Stonard for Alliance and Horde respectively. The teleport spells can be acquired from new class quests found in Theramore and Stonard at level 45, while the portal spells are acquired from tome drops in Lower Karazhan Halls.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Divine Shield now reduces the damage you deal by 50% instead of reducing attack speed by 100% during its duration. <br>
        Developer Note: One of paladin's strengths in PvP is their armor piercing Holy Strike. With 50% damage reduction while under effect of Divine Shield, it will be much harder from them to oneshot people with this ability, giving other classes more counterplay options. We closely monitor PvP balance in battlegrounds and Blood Ring and expect more balance changes targeted strictly at PvP soon.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Grace of the Sunwell mana cost reduced from 21% to 6% of base mana.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Feedback mana costs have been reduced to approximately 35% of their original values.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Cone of Cold and Hellfire now list their area of effect in the spell descriptions.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Added a new raid buff to Druids: Emerald Blessing. This ability can be acquired from Emerald Sanctum after a small questline. At the cost of one Bright Dream Shard, this aura grants raid members within 80 yards 10% movement speed, 1% spell hit and 5% mana regeneration in combat.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Glyph of the Ice Bear: Both alliance and horde versions received an appearance update, that has more animations, including dancing and sitting.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Flourish now has a 40 second cooldown to avoid cases where the Rogue would become avoidance capped.<br>
        Developer Note: Rogue tanking, while a cool and unique concept, has one major flaw. With avoidance based tanks, you either die instantly or do not require any healing at all. It leads to some encounters being trivialised, such as Patchwerk. It has also been brought to our attention that some crafty rogues use flourish to farm some end game bosses alone or in a much smaller group than intended. For that reason, we decided to put a cd on Flourish, to make reaching avoidance cap much harder. Expect more changes for rogue tanking, and rogue class as a whole in the next round of spell changes.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Mage's Brilliance Aura, Hunter's Trueshot Aura, and Paladin's Righteous Fury are all now treated as aura / state type spells. These spells no longer have a mana cost or duration and can be toggled on and off. They can also be active at the same time with other auras such as Paladin Auras and Hunter Aspects.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Champion's Grace is now available from Priest class trainers at level 40, usable if you have Proclaim Champion talented.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Each Totem Element now have their own global cooldown that's seperate from normal abilities, and totems that do not have a cooldown now have a 1.5 sec cooldown. This essentially allows macro-ing totems of different elements together to drop them at the same time.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Tree of Life's Aura now increases healing power instead of increasing healing by a flat value.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Trainer's ability description text for the ability Detection should now show the proper information.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Trainer's ability description text for the ability Agitating Poison should now show the proper information.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Agitating Poison I is now named Agitating Poison like other rogue spells where only one ability exists.</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>Trainer's ability description text for the ability Deadly Throw should now show the proper information.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Deadly Throw no longer shows a rank like other rogue spells where only one ability exists.</li></ul>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW TRANSPORT ROUTES</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li>New flight path: Everlook, Winterspring ↔ Nordanaar, Hyjal (Horde &amp; Alliance)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New flight path: Southshore, Hillsbrad Foothills ↔ Ravenshire, Gilneas</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New flight path: Tarren Mill, Hillsbrad Foothills ↔ Stillward Church, Gilneas</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New flight path: Bael Hardul, Stonetalon Mountains ↔ Astranaar, Ashenvale</li></ul>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW CLASS &amp; RACE COMBINATIONS</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Human Hunter.</strong> Many humans have been training vigorously with their newfound High Elven allies ever since they joined forces. They have been forging strong bonds with nature and honing their marksmanship skills. Finally, the first line of Human Hunters is now fully prepared and ready to face whatever challenges the world may present.<br>

    </ul>
    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Troll Warlock.</strong> The reunion of the forest trolls and the Darkspear tribes has resulted in a fusion of cultures. As a consequence, the prominence of dark magic has increased within troll society, offering new avenues for those who crave power. The audacious tusken kin, willing to pay the price, are now prepared to venture into the wider world. The question remains: Will you rise above all others, or will your insatiable hunger for power lead to your downfall?<br>

    </ul>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW TITLES &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></span>
    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Vagrant's Endeavor. </strong>Sick of snagging two-handed axes that are as useful as a screen door on a submarine? Fed up with trying to calculate how much intellect or spell damage you need to avoid becoming the laughing stock of your dungeon party? Fear not, my friend! <br>
        <br>
        The solution is here: join the Vagrant's Endeavor challenge and bid farewell to the headache of having to pick the right item stats! You'll be forced to wear nothing but poor or common quality gear until you hit level 60. Enchanting items is not permitted.<br>
        <br>
        But fear not, once you reach that milestone, you'll be rewarded with the coveted title of "The Wanderer" and a beat-up mule to lug around all your not-so-valuable possessions. Who needs rare items when you can have a donkey, am I right?<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/patch_1166/turtlewow_vagrantmode.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li></ul>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Lord of the Frogs. </strong>Are you a frog fanatic like us? Are you ready to hop around and explore every slimy corner in search of that rare breed? It's time to gather every frog in Azeroth and earn the legendary title of Lord of the Frogs! Let's ribbit our way to victory!<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/patch_1166/turtlewow_grandfrogus.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li></ul>
    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Crazy Cat Lady. </strong>Get ready to embark on a wild adventure of snatching up every feline you come across on the street! Bring them all back to your humble abode and claim the ultimate title of Crazy Cat Lady in the game. It's time to show the world just how much you're head-over-heels in love with these purrfect little creatures. Meow!<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/patch_1166/turtlewow_crazycatlady.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li>
    </ul>
    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Diplomat.</strong> You know what they say - you can't please everyone. But let's face it, who wants to be a people pleaser anyway? If you're ready to earn your title of Diplomat, it's time to prove the naysayers wrong! So, buckle up and get ready to cozy up with the Timbermaw Hold, Cenarion Circle, and Thorium Brotherhood.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/patch_1166/turtlewow_diplomat.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></li></ul>
    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Bloodthirsty. The next title is called Bloodthirsty, and does it live up to its name! Now, don't go all crazy and start biting necks left and right. We want you to maintain your honor points while you quench your thirst for blood. So, go ahead and show us your fangs, but make sure you do it with style and class. After all, we're not animals... or are we? Muahaha!</strong></li></ul>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW ZONES &amp; QUESTS</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Gilneas.</strong> Gilneas, once the proud home of a nation, now lies in ruins. Its despondent people struggle to survive, scavenging whatever scraps they can find from the remains. However, with the battered and broken gate of the Greymane Wall, the nation can now open its doors to the outside world, raising hope that Gilneas may flourish once more.<br>
        <br>
        This new zone, which ranges from level 39 to 45, is located south of Silverpine Forest. Beyond the Wall, you will discover town hubs for both factions, offering connections to established flight paths. The Ravenshire Rebellion calls upon the aid of the Alliance, while the Forsaken have occupied the Stillward Church and reunited with an ally from a distant past. It is up to you to support your faction's efforts, whether by aiding the remnants of Gilneas' people or helping the Horde establish a presence in these newly opened lands.<br>
        <br>
        As you venture through the zone, you will unravel the story of these forgotten lands, whether by participating in unfolding events or by delving into old manuscripts that describe the ancient legends and mythos of the Gilnean people. Rest assured, your efforts will not go unrewarded.<br>

        Turtle WoW is a community-driven project, and we are grateful to those who contribute their unique talents to enhance it! We thank Stonegut, the skilled warrior, for creating the amazing promotional artwork for our upcoming Patch 1.17.0.<br>

        As time goes by, we continue to construct our own narrative to work in conjunction with World of Warcraft. With each patch, we gain more confidence to alter the story without breaking the magic of the original game. We have created a small cartoon in collaboration with the talented Evgeniy Moiseev. This is the first step in creating tales not only within the game, but in other media as well!<br>
        <br>

        <em class="text-italics">Once the proud home of a mighty nation, it now lies in ruins, with despondent people struggling to survive on the scraps they can scavenge. However, with the Greymane Wall's gate now battered and broken, the nation is opening its doors to the outside world after many years, and there is hope that it may flourish once again.</em><br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Hyjal.</strong> <em class="text-italics">Perched atop the peaks of Kalimdor, Hyjal has long been a sacred place for the Night Elves, serving as a constant watch against the horrors of the past. Archimonde's bones, a haunting reminder of the War of the Ancients, adorn Nordrassil. Recently, the once secluded Hyjal has opened its gates, beckoning for aid in the battle against the growing Nightmare and demonic corruption that plagues the mountain. It is crucial that we climb Mount Hyjal and join the fight against this evil, lest we return to the dark days of ten thousand years ago, or worse. <br>
    </em><br>
        Hyjal is a new zone designed for endgame content, available to players at levels 58-60. To access the zone, venture through the tunnel located at the southern end of Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring. As you ascend, you will encounter unfamiliar creatures such as the dark trolls of Zul'Hatha, the Vilemusk satyr that has infiltrated the corrupted sections of the region, and the corrupted Barkskin furbolg. Eventually, you will arrive at Nordrassil, the world tree, and the town of Nordanaar, which serves as the main hub for this zone. Nordanaar also offers a flight path connecting to Everlook. <br>
        <br>
        Within Hyjal, you will find the Emerald Gateway, the entrance to Emerald Sanctum, a new 40-man raid in the Blackwing Lair difficulty. This raid offers an optional hard mode, where you must combat the influence of the Nightmare and stop Solnius from initiating the Awakening, which would cause the corrupted Green Dragonflight to rampage across Azeroth. Before entering the raid, completion of an attunement questline in Hyjal is required. <br>
        <br>
        In addition to the standard quests, there are repeatable quests in Hyjal that reward Dream Shards. Collect enough of these shards to exchange them for various rewards, including equipment forged from Dream infused materials. These repeatable quests can be completed individually, as a group for elite content, or through item turn-ins.<br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">New Alliance town: Gnomegeran Reclamation Facility.</strong> The Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility is the result of gnomekind's collective efforts to reclaim their city. Located in Dun Morogh, it serves as the new home for the Gnomeregan Exiles. This Alliance town offers familiar amenities like an auction house and bank, as well as general goods vendors. Former residents of Tinker Town, Ironforge, have relocated here, along with new gnomes joining the cause. The facility provides quests for reclaiming Gnomeregan, including a section overrun by toxic components. While you will be rewarded for your helping efforts, be cautious of the gadgets you receive, as they may turn you into a test subject.<br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Ronae'Thalas</strong>. <em class="text-italics">We have escaped the mad prince's clutches and are now free. However, we must confront the horrors and mistakes we allowed to happen. Our family and people were sacrificed for nothing, and we have only suffered losses. But this ends now. While Eldre'Thalas may be lost, we are not. We can start anew, regain our dignity, and find our place in this vastly changed world.</em><br>
        <br>
        Ronae'Thalas, a new questing area, is available for adventurers at level 54. It revolves around the Shen'dralar Highborne who have rejected Tortheldrin's ways and fled the city. They have settled in the ruins of a magical academy east of Feralas, hoping to find their place in the world again. To unlock Ronae'Thalas, speak to Azj'tordin in the Lariss Pavillon in Feralas after completing his quest: "Pusillin and the Elder Azj'Tordin." Ronae'Thalas offers quests and daily quests that grant Shen'dralar reputation. It is part of an ongoing storyline featuring this group of Highborne. The Alliance High elves and the Horde Forsaken have also sent representatives to gain favor with the Highborne. You can choose to assist your faction's representative to earn more reputation and rewards.<br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Gilneas City.</strong> At the heart of this once-isolated land lies Gilneas City, which was once a bastion of hope for its people. Established after breaking free from the rule of the Arathorian lords, it stood as a symbol of resilience and prosperity. However, it is now a mere shell of its former beauty, with a dark presence casting a gripping shadow over Gilneas and serving as a reminder of its once glorious past. Distant howls echo through the city, haunting reminders of its new occupants. Yet, there is a possibility that not everyone is gone and that their accursed king may still live.<br>
        <br>
        Gilneas City is a new level 43-49 dungeon located in its namesake zone, featuring sprawling streets and homes now in disrepair, while the towers that reach for the skies cast their shadows over you as you make your way through the streets to the heart of the city. The dungeon includes two mini-bosses and five normal bosses, with plenty of new loot to acquire as you liberate the city, including armaments of the Gilneas Guard. We cannot reveal too much about the dungeon as it is closely tied to the story of the zone at large, but we can say that you should not expect only worgen to roam the alleyways.<br>

        <ul><li>The Harbinger and Infinite Chromie boss encounters and the Aqir section have been revamped to be more time related with new custom spells and effects, with the two bosses being replaced with two totally new encounters: <strong class="text-strong">Drifting Avatar of Time and Epidamu</strong>.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rotmaw and Mossheart are no longer rare bosses and can now always be found in the swamp section of the dungeon, raising the total boss count to 7.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Properly linked all trash mob packs.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The stats of almost all creatures have seen adjustments to make sure the difficulty is where it was intended to be.</li></ul>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW END-GAME RAIDS</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Emerald Sanctum.</strong> <em class="text-italics">A fog of corruption has descended upon the Emerald Dream, twisting the morals and intentions of even the noblest and purest. The corrupted Wakener is preparing to send a premature call of awakening; if not stopped, his kin will arise and go on a frenzied rampage across Azeroth.</em><br>
        <br>
        Emerald Sanctum is the first 40-Man Raid being introduced to the server. It can be accessed after completing its attunement chain in Hyjal. This raid is specifically designed for raiders who are actively progressing in Blackwing Lair, which can be considered the Onyxia's Lair for this raid tier. The instance consists of one mini boss, Erennius, and one main boss, Solnius the Awakener. We won't delve into too much detail as the element of mystery is part of the experience. However, you can expect to encounter debilitating afflictions and face the full wrath of the Green Dragonflight unleashed upon your raid.<br>
        <br>
        A new slew of appearances await fellow druids in Hyjal, rarely dropping from Solnius in the Emerald Sanctum.<br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong">Lower Karazhan Halls.</strong> <em class="text-italics">Karazhan, once the towering stronghold of the former Guardian of Tirisfal, now hums with magical energy as it perches atop a powerful leyline. Its long-forgotten corridors, covered in dust, have become a haven for various creatures, though it appears that not all of its inhabitants have willingly departed. In the depths of the lower halls, Medivh's loyal castellan, Moroes, remains a vigilant guardian. If you manage to impress him, he may grant you access to the upper floors.</em><br>
        <br>
        Lower Karazhan Halls is a 10-man raid that can be accessed via the front door of the Karazhan Tower, not requiring any attunements to enter. Designed to offer a challenge similar to Molten Core, the lower halls are inhabited by a multitude of unfamiliar creatures, unlike their later iterations in subsequent expansions. Within these halls, you will encounter six formidable bosses, each dropping items of equal difficulty level. The final boss, however, will reward you with items on par with the treasures of Majordomo Executus.<br>
        <br>
        Prepare yourself for a plethora of new relics, pseudo item sets and a multitude of treasures imbued with unprecedented powers.<br>
