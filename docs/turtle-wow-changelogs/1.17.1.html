    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW STARTING EXPERIENCE FOR GOBLINS AND HIGH ELVES</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FFBF40">New Zone: Thalassian Highlands.</span></strong> Located at the remote fringes of Quel'thalas, these lands were initially established as an outpost for Alah'Thalas. Over time, with your assistance, it has developed into a thriving city, complete with its own dock. However, one must not be deceived by the beauty of these lands, for lurking in the shadows are sinister forces, even within the city walls. This zone now serves as the starting point for fledgling High Elves, providing a comprehensive level 1-10 experience.<br>
        <br>
        <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FFBF40">Note:</span></strong> All High Elves below level 10 in the Farstrider Lodge will be automatically moved to the Thalassian Highlands when the patch is released.<br>

    </ul>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FFBF40">New Zone: Blackstone Island.</span></strong> After escaping from the lands of Stonetalon Mountains, the goblins of the Durotar Labor Union have succumbed to their biggest weakness: greed. They have seized control of an island rich in natural resources, but this new empire has been built on the backs of hopeful goblins who sought an escape from the clutches of the Venture Co. These new recruits found themselves trapped in a similar predicament again, only this time under new management. It is now your responsibility to break free from the chains of poverty and claim your rightful place in the Durotar Labor Union. This zone serves as the new starting point for fledgling goblins, offering an expanded level 1-10 experience.<br>
        <br>
        <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FFBF40">Note:</span></strong> All Goblins in the Venture Camp will be automatically moved to the Blackstone Island when the patch is released.<br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW LOCATIONS</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FFBF40">New Subzone: Forlorn Summit.</span></strong> Forgotten and decayed, this cliff holds Prince Arthas Menethil’s base from which he issued the Culling of Stratholme during the Scourge’s infestation by the Cult of the Damned. In his fervent pursuit of Mal’Ganis, he abandoned this outpost - unbeknownst to the Silver Hand, Arthas’ suspicions were about to be verified: among the refugees of Stratholme were not only bearers of the Plague of Undeath, but also remaining agents of the Cult of the Damned, Kel’thuzad’s necromantic acolytes. To this day, the Forlorn Summit is a breeding ground of vile sorcery and crimes against all life. Are you valiant enough to stand against Kel’thuzad’s sect?<br>

    </ul>

    <ul><li><strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#FFBF40">New Subzone: Venture Camp and Broken Cliff Mine.</span></strong> The Venture Company have finally arrived to check on Nert Blastentom and his crew's mission, to find no trace of their (now-ex) employees. They've now dug open a way to the valley to find a clue to their whereabouts and to finish the mission that was tasked to them all that time ago: Drain the land of all of its resources.<br>
