    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">RACIAL CHANGES</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Racials in Vanilla have always been a tricky topic. On one hand, they encourage diversity and avoid homogenization by having races excel in niches through unique traits, this fits Vanilla flavor perfectly. On the other hand however it is common knowledge that the Horde has always had the upper hand when it comes to combat racials, especially in PvP. Our changes to these Racials sought to remedy this issue by keeping Racials unique and flavorful to their race while evening out the power of the outliers. That being said, after extensive discussions and player feedback we realize that some Racials were hit too hard while others got a little less love than they deserve.</i></span>
