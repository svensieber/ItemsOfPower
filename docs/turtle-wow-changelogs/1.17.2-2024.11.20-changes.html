<div class="content">The first batch of changes post 1.17.2 release are out. Mind you that with the changed situation of having the launcher we will do updates way more frequently. We're still incredibly busy getting enough data and making sure every bug that impacts class balance is fixed so we're starting conservatively for most classes.<br>
    <br>
    Please make sure to also visit the November 20 changelog as this contains quite some bug fixes that might alter player / class power.<br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">HUNTER</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>We're redistributing power of Hunter's Marksmanship a little as Improved Steady Shot was overvalued and Piercing Shot undervalued. We're also looking into reducing the major power upgrade Survival Hunters got this patch while leveling.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">PALADIN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Paladin is another class where the power we gave them for this patch trivialized leveling and even some end game content for Protection. We're addressing both by tuning down some of these talents &amp; abilities.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>We overshot Discipline by quite some, both in PvE and PvP. These changes seek to correct this as well as give Shadow some love back.</i></span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">SHAMAN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Enhancement DPS is currently doing worse than we'd like it to, therefore we are slowly but surely putting power back in. We have noticed though just like other classes &amp; builds that power we've given overbuffed these builds while leveling, we are addressing this as well.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Stormstrike</span> can now proc weapon enhancement effects.
    <hr>

    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>The Drain Soul build-up we added doesn't quite achieve what we wanted it to and thus we are removing it and instead putting a little extra power in the base damage.</i></span>
    <hr> <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Dark Harvest</span> Spellpower scaling increased from 20% to 25%.
    <hr>
