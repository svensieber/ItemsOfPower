<div class="content">The second batch of changes post 1.17.2 release are coming. Below are the changes outlined that are slated for <strong class="text-strong">this week</strong>. Keep a close eye on our forums and Discord to be notified of the exact time and date.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#4bd3ff"><strong class="text-strong">UPDATES | Dated: December 20 2024 [Revised: December 22]</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">DRUID</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Now several weeks into our second round of class changes, we we’re able to observe how our druid changes played out in the hands of our community. We are overall happy with how Balance and Restoration play out, even if the former still has some minor things that can be ironed out regarding the reward or proper rotation. Feral Combat on the other hand is a double-edged sword at the moment. While both Bear and Cat are performing well, Bear even more than we imagined, there are still details left we wish to address. In case of Feral Cat, we wish to explore and expand their identity more beyond the 20-year-old Powershifting and add power to non-Powershifters.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Open Wounds:</span> Effect reworked to the following: "Increases the damage of Claw by 10/20/30% and Ferocious Bite by 3/4/5% for each of your active Bleed effects on the target." <br>
    <br>
    Feral Aggression and Open Wounds now increase Ferocious Bite's total damage instead of its base damage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’ve taken steps in establishing a new identity for Feral Cats before, enhancing their abilities through application of their Bleed effects. We’d like to go further with this design by enabling Open Wounds to all three Bleed effects available to Feral Cats and including Ferocious Bite into its functionality. </i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ancient Brutality:</span> Periodic ticks of your Bleed effects restore 2/3/4 Energy while in Cat Form. Dodging an attack while in Bear or Dire Bear Form regenerates 1/2/3 rage per second for 5 seconds. This effect can only occur once every 9 seconds. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Taking this further, we also allow ticks of their Bleed effects to restore energy. This is one of many steps taken to deepen the synergies brought forth by Bleeds. However, the Bear side of this talent was outperforming for the bonus it gives and the amount of uptime. To combat this, we’ve increased the cooldown on the talent and removed the extra vampirism to even out its power.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Feral Adrenaline:</span> Dodge bonus increased from 15/30/45% to 20/40/60%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We are increasing the Dodge chance to make this talent more reliable when it is triggered.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Swipe:</span> Attack Power scaling reduced from 6% to 4%. <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Frenzied Regeneration:</span> Cooldown reduced from 6 to 5 minutes. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Frenzied Regeneration feels a bit too weak right now, so we’re giving it power back by reducing its cooldown.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Balance of All Things:</span> Starfire cast time reduction increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Casting Starfire to gain Natural Eclipse after finishing Arcane Eclipse can often feel sluggish. We’re upping the granted cast time reduction of Astral Boon to help players who activate Eclipse more consistently.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Eclipse:</span> Now adds a corresponding debuff when triggering an Eclipse, lasting for 30 seconds, showing which Eclipse is on its cooldown. <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff">Savage Bite:</span> Damage reduced from 100% Weapon Damage + 61 to 80% Weapon Damage + 30.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While we see Feral Bears as a threat focused tank, their overall power overshot its target. We’re dialing their threat a bit back with this change.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Grizzled Hide (Feral Tier 3 8 Set):</span> Duration increased to 15 seconds, maximum stacks down from 10 to 4, Damage reduction increased from 1% to 2%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Following Savage Bite’s increased cooldown, we’re giving Grizzled Hide a little bit more wiggle room to play with.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rip</span> no longer replaces Pounce when applied on the same target.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">MAGE</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Mages of all specializations are currently performing quite well, so these changes will be quite light. These changes mainly focus on very slightly reducing the performance of Arcane Rupture and making Hot Streak a more active part of a Fire Mage's rotation for all level and gear ranges as the talent struggled severely due to its steep requirement.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Rupture:</span> Spellpower scaling reduced from 100% to 90%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hot Streak:</span> Cast time reduction per stack increased from 0.5 to 1 seconds, maximum amount of stacks reduced from 9 to 5.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Hot Streak has quite struggled to be maxed out in stacks, especially in leveling and early raiding so we're reducing the amount of stacks required to max out alongside increasing the effectiveness of each stack, which should make this talent a lot more impactful.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff">Icicles:</span> Global cooldown reduced from 1.5 to 1 second.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">HUNTER</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Hunter overall is doing well, with Marksmanship excelling on boss encounters while Survival excels at handling bigger groups of enemies. Even with this being the case, we're making a few changes to Survival to slightly reduce the gap between it and Marksmanship for single target damage with the Vicious Bite change. In addition to this, we'll be slightly improving Carve as the last batch of changes has hit it a bit too harshly, causing it to be worse than its ranged counterpart Multi-Shot.<br>
    <br>
    As for Beast Mastery, we're adding weapon skill to Bestial Precision to improve the Hunter pet's performance for higher level enemies such as raid bosses via higher damaging glancing blows without affecting player combat which should help quite a lot to pull it closer to the other two specializations.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mongoose Bite:</span> Now requires a weapon to use.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vicious Bite:</span> Renamed to Vicious Strikes and now does the following: Your Mongoose Bite and Raptor Strike now deal 10/20% additional weapon damage.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Carve:</span> Increased weapon damage to the following:
    <ul><li>Rank 1: 50% to 60%</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2: 55% to 65%</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3: 60% to 70%</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Our previous changes to Carve ended up being a bit too heavy, causing it to be not be equal to Multi-Shot in the same levels, so we're slightly increasing its damage to equalize it.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bestial Precision:</span> Now also increases your pet's weapon skill by 5/10.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change to Bestial Precision should make it so your pets' glancing blows are way less punishing which greatly helps against high level creatures while having little to no effect for player combat.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Steady Shot:</span> Reduced the weapon damage scaling for lower ranks. The values go as follows:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 20): 60% + 10</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 30): 70% + 20</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 40): 80% + 30</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 50): 90% + 40</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 60): 100% + 50 (Same as before.)</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The current damage of Steady Shot in early levels ended up being too overbearing, allowing hunters to have an even faster kill time in the early levels. For this reason we've made the weapon damage scaling component scale with every rank alongside the flat damage modifier which should curb this issue.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Stinging Nettle Lacing:</span> Talent description now properly lists that Serpent Stings applied with this talent ignore resistances and immunities.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">PALADIN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Patch 1.17.2 introduced a significant rework to the Paladin class, with some of the most extensive changes to core abilities among all classes. Overall, we are pleased with the outcome, as the reworked abilities have introduced fresh gameplay dynamics and improved the class's overall feel.
    <hr>
    <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#ffbf40">Protection Paladin</span></strong><br>
    Our data indicates that Protection Paladin is currently overtuned, and we are implementing adjustments to address this imbalance. These changes are aimed at bringing the spec closer in line with other tanks while maintaining its unique identity and gameplay strengths.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#ffbf40">Retribution Paladin</span></strong><br>
    To enhance build diversity, we are restoring Seal of Righteousness scaling to a level closer to its pre-patch state. This adjustment should provide greater viability for spell power-based builds, encouraging alternative playstyles and rewarding creative theorycrafting. In addition, Retribution receives minor changes to talents.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Paladin</span></strong><br>
    The melee-focused Holy Paladin playstyle has been underperforming in terms of raw output, and we are introducing buffs to improve its viability. These adjustments will also slightly increase the overall power of caster-focused Holy Paladins, ensuring both playstyles remain competitive and rewarding.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Exorcism:</span> Now generates 70% less threat.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While we believe that additional power of paladins against Undead enemies is a great flavor for the class, the instant threat generation of Protection Paladin in specific Undead fights is a bit too high. For balance reasons, we reduce the threat generated by Exorcism while keeping the damage.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Retribution/Protection Tier 3 6 piece bonus:</span> Now only reduces the cooldown of Exorcism.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This tier set bonus provided an increase against Undead enemies that was simply too high, discouraging paladins from ever using their non-tier offpieces.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crusader Strike:</span> Damage is now normalized.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: All instant melee attacks were normalized in patch 1.8, but this adjustment was inadvertently overlooked during the introduction of Crusader Strike. Normalization ensures that, when calculating the ability's damage, the attack speed component of the formula defaults to 3.3 for two-handed weapons and 2.4 for one-handed weapons. This change results in a damage increase for faster weapons and a slight reduction for slower ones.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Seal of Righteousness:</span> Spell power scaling increased to 0.082 * weapon speed for One-Handed Weapons and 0.098 * weapon speed for Two-Handed Weapons.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change is meant to increase the viability of hybrid Retribution Paladin builds and allow Protection Paladins to have more threat generation built into their basic attacks.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff">Righteous Strikes:</span> Holy Strike additional threat generation reduced from 10/20/30/40/50% to 6/12/18/24/30%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To offset the Seal of Righteousness scaling increase, we are reducing the additional threat provided from Holy Strike.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff">Holy Shield:</span> Spell power scaling reduced from 33% to 15%, block chance reduced from 50% to 45% and additional threat generation reduced from 45% to 30%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To offset the Seal of Righteousness scaling increase, we are reducing scaling and additional threat provided from Holy Shield. We believe this change will allow Protection Paladins to perform better as off-tanks, while weakening their main tank threat generation.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment (Update): The cooldown for this ability will remain unchanged for now. However, we are exploring potential adjustments in the future to better distinguish its functionality from the warrior's Shield Block, ensuring each ability feels unique and aligns with its intended design philosophy.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vengeance:</span> Now increases all damage dealt instead of just Holy and Physical.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change is aimed to simplify and streamline the way Paladin scales, while removing some unintended power from abilities that benefited from both Physical and Holy schools at once.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crusading Strikes:</span> Renamed to "Vengeful Strikes" and Crusader Strike damage bonus reduced from 3/6/9/12/15% to 2/4/6/8/10%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Strike:</span> Self healing reduced by 50% and now targets up to 4 wounded allies within 10 yards instead of being limited to your party.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessed Strikes:</span> Holy Strike base healing increase reduced from 30/60/90/120/150% to 20/40/60/80/100% but now benefits from an additional 5/10/15/20/25% of your healing power.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Reduction of self-healing aims to reduce strength of Paladins in leveling and solo content.<br>
In addition, we decided to modify how the heal provided from Holy Strike works: the healing is now raid-wide. We believe this change will help close the gap between melee and caster Holy Paladin. In addition, while base increase from talent is reduced, it now scales much better with gear, which will ultimately make it more worthwhile to use for geared paladins.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Divine Favor:</span> Holy Shock critical chance bonus increased from 6/12/18/24/30% to 10/20/30/40/50%. <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Daybreak:</span> Healing taken from Holy Shock increased from 20% to 30%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessing of Light:</span> Now also increases the healing power of Holy Shock by the following amounts:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 40): 120</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 50): 180</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 60): 240</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i> Developer Comment: Changes above are meant to make Holy Shock a more valuable button to press. It should incentivise using Holy Shock compared to Flash of Light for both melee and caster builds.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <hr>

    Normally we do not share bugfixes in balance changes posts but because there are some that are particularly important to Paladin's balance they will be shared here too:<br>

    <ul><li>Judgements applied by other paladins will now be refreshed by Crusader Strike and Holy Strike.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Healing Light talent now increases total healing instead of base healing.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Corrected damage gain from Improved Seal of Righteousness.</li></ul>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">PRIEST</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Even though the specializations are performing well and we're very happy with the flavor of our Discipline tree, we have a few things on our sights for Priest. A few of the capstones and keystones haven't been performing up to our standards, which will see improvements with this round of balance changes. Additionally, we'll be changing Wand Specialization so it also functions for bows, making them more of a viable alternative for Night Elf Priests that want to live out their fantasy.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Champion:</span> Mana returned from damage taken by your champion increased from 1% to 2%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Chastise:</span> Global cooldown reduced from 1.5 to 1 seconds.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Resurgent Shield:</span> Holy spellpower granted when Power Word: Shield breaks increased from 6% to 10% of the shield's total absorption amount.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While this talent was aimed at reinforcing the supportive side of Discipline, it fell a bit short of being powerful enough to warrant shielding an ally over casting another Smite. This is quite a hefty increase, so we'll be monitoring its performance for further adjustments if needed.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Wand Specialization:</span> Now also affects Bows.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change is aimed at making the Night Elf Priest racial ability to wield bows more equal to using a conventional wand.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Night Elf Priest:</span> Casting a spell resets your bow's shot timer.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Starshards:</span> Has seen several adjustments:
    <ul><li>Damage has been reduced by 10% for all ranks.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Channeling effect has been changed from Physical to Magic.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Range reduced from 30 to 25 yards.</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Starshards has been performing quite well but it has increased creature and player kill times a bit more than we have intended. While the damage reduction is small, we've added further counterplay against this spell for player combat.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">SHAMAN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    The shaman class has proven to be one of our most stable and popular class after the initial set of changes, we are excited to see how the community will flesh the class' specs out thanks to its rising popularity as a damage dealer as well, it has also proven to be one of the most balanced and well-structured classes too.<br>
    <br>
    We are generally satisfied with how elemental has risen among the other classes as a very capable and efficient multi-target damage-dealer while not falling behind on its single-target capabilities. Future efforts will be devoted to increasing the class' complexity while maintaining a generally simple rotational playstyle more in line with the other casters, we hope you'll be as excited as us to see how efforts in this regard play out.<br>
    <br>
    Enhancement, thanks to a steady supply of cautious buffs, the class is rising as a top contender for high single-target damage-dealing during its windows of power, namely Bloodlust. We are looking closely at player-driven performance optimization for the specialization itself and are glad to see the bustling playerbase forming around the specialization now that it is equipped with a more modern and coherent framework in tune with the base shaman toolkit. Future efforts will be devoted to carefully tuning the class and bring it on par with other melee single-target damage-dealers.<br>
    <br>
    As with Elemental, Restoration's changes were driven by the will to whittle away at the class' shortcoming and flesh out its established gameplay in a manner that would keep it both fun and effective. We are satisfied with its performance after the changes and how players are now able to confidently pick its dedicated talents and enjoy a level of power driven by their choice of class customization and a more linear and less restraining gear progression which does not stifle creativity and player agency.<br>
    <br>
    With these closing remarks, we hope the shaman community keeps expanding as we are excited to see where and how our players bring out the class' potential.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flurry (Shaman):</span> Attack speed bonus increased from 7/9/11/13/15% to 8/11/14/17/20%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ancestral Knowledge:</span> Effect changed from 2/4/6/8/10% base stats to 1/2/3/4/5% total stats.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flame Shock:</span> Duration increased from 12 to 15 seconds &amp; initial damage scaling increased from 6% to 8.5% Attack Power.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Our vision for Shaman is to have all the shocks hold a position across the 3 specs. This small bump to Flame Shock's quality should make it easier to keep up for Elemental as well as to make it a valuable option for the Enhancement rotation.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lightning Strike:</span> Can now proc Windfury Weapon.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: True to a line of incremenetal buffs to Enhancement over the course of multiple weeks coupled with a close analysis of player performance, we are confident this final wave of buffs will bring Enhancement to a satisfactory performance level, especially as a strong single-target damage dealer outside of the Bloodlust window. We are also sure this Lightning Strike buff will make the specialization come together as a more coherent and enjoyable iteration of the Shaman class.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Electrify:</span> Maximum stacks reduced from 5 to 2. Each stack grants 50% critical strike damage bonus and 5% increased Nature damage. Effect duration reduced from 20 to 15 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Balancing the value of Electrify's stacks will ensure the class can still enjoy a ramping power level over the course of a fight without over-reliance on Elemental Mastery as a cooldown or the use of unintuitive tactics to perform at an appropriate level.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Elemental Mastery:</span> Now grants 1 stack of Electrify instead of 2 stacks.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Elemental Tier 3 (8 Set):</span> Shock damage bonus increased from 4% to 10%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change is to compensate for the maximum stack reduction on Electrify, its overall power should be slightly better with it being maxed out faster.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Water Shield:</span> Reworked, new function is the following: "You restore 3/6/9 mana per 5 sec while your Water Shield is active, and for each charge currently active your total passive mana regeneration rate is increased by 1/1.5/2%."<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Elemental Weapons:</span> Flametongue Weapon's Fire damage bonus increased from 5/10/15% to 10/20/30%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">WARLOCK</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    After a majority of larger bugs being fixed and players getting used to the new specs and itemization for them Warlocks seem to be pushing above average dps with some of the specs performing below expectations.<br>
    <br>
    For Shadow and Fire Destruction Warlocks, the changes aim to bring more consistency and smaller dependency on others.<br>
    <br>
    Affliction is receiving various damage increases to bring it up to other specs with also a change to Resilient Shadows talent to make it more useful.<br>
    <br>
    Demonology needed the most help with making Soul Link more desirable to pick by leaning more into Greater Demons synergy. Unleashed Potential is also getting tweaked to make it more interesting to keep up without having to solely rely on RNG. Many of the spells of your demons received Spell Power scaling to properly benefit from the stats they are getting from Fel Intellect and Unleashed Potential.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Shadow Bolt:</span> Now has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to be applied on critical hit. Chance on hit application chance reduced from 5/10/15/20/25% to 2/4/6/8/10%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Soul Fire:</span> The buff is now applied on cast instead of when the Soul Fire hits, and the buff duration is increased from 25 to 30 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Having the chance for this crucial part of your rotation to miss didn't feel good and made Destruction Warlock's performance too inconsistent at moments where it should reward you so we're guaranteeing the buff's application alongside allowing it to have a near full uptime.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Resilient Shadows:</span> Reworked to the following: "Now reduces the chance your Affliction spells will be dispelled by an additional 3/6/9%."<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Drains:</span> Now increases the effectiveness of your Drain Soul, Drain Life and Drain Mana by 5/10%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change means that Improved Drains also increases the damage of your Drain Soul alongside its previous benefits.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nightfall:</span> Shadow Bolts casted with Nightfall are now guaranteed to land.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Siphon:</span> Damage increase for each of your Affliction effects increased from 2/3/4% to 2/4/6%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Domination:</span> Cast time reduction increased from 4 to 4.5 seconds.<br>

    <hr>

    Greater and Enslaved Demons will now be affected by your <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Intellect</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Stamina</span> talents.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Scaling on all of these demon spells benefit from the demon's Intellect stat that each converts to 1 Spell Power. It further scales from the Fel Intellect talent and the raw Spell Power from Unleashed Potential talent.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">ROGUE</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    The damage output of Rogue hasn't quite met our expectations, with Combat and Assassination struggling to compete with other damage dealers. For this reason we'll be adding scaling to class-specific poisons to allow them to shine above other widely available options such as sharpening stones while increasing the importance of Assassination specific talents. In addition to this, Surprise Attack has seen a small rework to make it feel more like a surprise attack, Relentless Strikes feeling especially relentless with it gradually increasing the lethality of your finishers and much more.<br>
    We hope that with these changes that Rogues will once again shine as the lethal assassins they were meant to be.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Relentless Strikes:</span> Energy return reduced from 25 to 20 and now also increases the damage of your finishing moves by 5%, stacking up to 5 times. Lasts 30 seconds.<br>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Energy return from Relentless Strikes and the energy cost for the finishers were reduced at the same amounts as a Quality of Life change, allowing you to use your finishers without having to wait for another energy tick required to use your finisher. Additionally, the stacking finisher damage increase should not change much for player combat but should be quite effective for creature combat, rewarding consistent finishers.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Instant Poison:</span> Now gains damage equal to 5% of your Attack Power.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Deadly and Corrosive Poison:</span> Now gains damage equal to 2% of your Attack Power for each tick of damage, equaling to 8% for the full duration for each stack of the application.<br>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tricks of the Trade:</span> Buff duration increased from 10 to 12 seconds.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Surprise Attack:</span> Now an instant attack and now deals 25% of your Attack Power instead of 120% Weapon Damage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Our first iteration of Surprise Attack didn't quite nail the feeling of actually being a surprise attack due to it being a queued attack, so we're changing it to an instant attack which should also reduce cases where its activation period runs out before you can use it with your next auto-attack.</i></span>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">WARRIOR</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Warrior has seen numerous changes in 1.17.2 with some of them being design-altering. We're mostly happy with the changes we've made thus far but do have some upcoming key changes that will be implemented.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arms</span> is mostly in a good spot right now. We've tried to push Arms into the more precise and calculated gameplay design and our Execute changes have helped with that. That being said, we feel that it could use a little extra push to really play out that design.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Protection</span>, especially Deep Protection, was something that was not very attractive to play in 1.12 Vanilla and in CC1 because of better alternatives. In 1.17.2 we tried to spice the tree up so this would change and while it's certainly in a better state than it was previously we're not fully there yet so we're giving it some love in the deep talents.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fury</span>. We liked the state 1.12 and CC1 Fury was in (disregarding its overly good scaling) but felt that a core part of its kit, Enrage, was heavily tied to receiving damage and thus would not shine in certain situations. 1.17.2 saw changes to Fury to address this by allowing Enrage to proc from Bloodthirst. However, while we've had plenty of indifferent feedback the negative feedback outweighed the positive especially in end-game. The main criticism that came from these changes is that Fury's DPS done per fight didn't reflect their skill as much as it used to, key moments of a fight without having an Enrage proc would feel worse. Because of this, we will be partially reverting the changes we've made and continue to monitor how Fury does in all types of content.
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bloodthirst</span> has seen numerous changes:
    <ul><li>No longer damages you, therefore can no longer proc Enrage.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Now increases your movement speed by 5% for 6 seconds. This effect stacks with other movement speed increases.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Base damage has been increased:
        <ul><li>Rank 1: 80 -&gt; 100</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 2: 100 -&gt; 130</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 3: 120 -&gt; 160</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 4: 150 -&gt; 200</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <ul><li>Attack Power scaling has been increased from 30% to 35%.</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The reasoning of why has been explained up top.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Enrage:</span> Damage bonus has been increased from 3/6/9/12/15% to 4/8/12/16/20%. <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Concussion Blow</span> has seen several changes:
    <ul><li>Cooldown has been reduced from 45 to 20 seconds.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Armor penetration has been increased from 50% to 100%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Stun duration has been reduced from 5 to 2 seconds.</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This ability should now better serve as a very strong threat opener for tanks, while remaining similarly okay for mid-fight threat and for crowd control elsewhere. </i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Decisive Strike:</span> Removed.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Slam:</span> Now has a 2.5 sec cast time, continues your weapon swing timer, and lets you move while casting, just like Decisive Strike did.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Slam:</span> Now has multiple ranks with the following level requirements and damage values:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 14): 50% Weapon Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 24): 60% Weapon Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 34): 70% Weapon Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 44): 80% Weapon Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 54): 90% Weapon Damage</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: In 1.17.2, we launched Slam in a state where it only pauses your swing timer. However, Decisive Strike shipped with a bug that allowed the timer to keep going. There was an overwhelming feedback to keep the behavior of this Decisive Strike, and very little was said about Slam's pause. Upon further reflection, we do not feel that the difference between these two abilities as is, is distinct enough to warrant keeping both in (similar to our self-cricisim about old Decisive Strike being just a Movement version of old Slam.). As such, we are shelving the swing timer pause idea and have promoted Decisive Strike to Slam's place. If you did prefer the pause version, keep note that we are still interested in seeing it back in the game, just under a more sensible game system than a copied baseline ability.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master of Arms:</span> Mace armor penetration reduced from 2/4/6/8/10 to 1.2/2.4/3.6/4.8/6 per level, meaning its reduced from 600 to 360 at Level 60.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The intention of this talent's design is to empower those who switch weapons to match the sitatuion. While we identify that the Mace aspect can be useless when up against a target with no armor remaining, the values we had before were far too strong against most encounters.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff">Precision Cut:</span> Now causes Execute to refund 10/20/30% of the rage spent upon hit.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff">Execute:</span> Values reverted to original values:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 24): 125 Damage + 3 Damage for each extra point of rage.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 32): 200 Damage + 6 Damage for each extra point of rage.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 40): 325 Damage + 9 Damage for each extra point of rage.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 48): 450 Damage + 12 Damage for each extra point of rage.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 56): 600 Damage + 15 Damage for each extra point of rage.</li></ul> <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We've taken another look at Execute, and with the realization that with this change, whirlwind would have become higher priority than Execute. We've decided to simply bring Execute back to vanilla values, and we will see how Arms feels now that there is no longer an incentive to maximize rage before Executing.<br>
<br>
The fact that Slam is normalized has been overlooked, we want to bring this to the attention that those with 3.8s weapons should see about a -18% damage nerf with this ability, and less of a nerf for those with faster weapons.<br>
<br>
As we have gone back on the Precision Cut nerf, we also will go back on the Mortal Strike buff in effort to tighten the variance of Arms' performance in various settings.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Execute:</span> Cooldown reduced from 5.5 to 4.5 seconds.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reckless Execute:</span> Rank 1 cooldown reduction reduced from 2 to 1.5 seconds. Rank 2 removes Execute cooldown as it did before.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Defensive Tactics:</span> Threat modifier has been increased from 55/110/165% to 60/120/180%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're still cooking up a good way to re-word this talent. The point of this talent is to allow tanks wearing shields to sacrifice mitigation for more threat by swapping in and out of Defensive Stance. With this buff to this talent, players should experience noticably higher threat done, outside than inside Defensive Stance.</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Shield Slam:</span> Cooldown reduction increased from 0.5/1 to 0.75/1.5 seconds and block buff duration reduced from 5 to 4.5 seconds.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Revenge:</span> Cooldown increased from 5 to 6 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Revenge, and Shield Slam and all Execute variations shall now be able to align with the GCD, for a more fluid experience with these short cooldowns. As Whirlwind is a longer cooldown, it has deliberately not be given the same treatment.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">Items</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Stratholme Holy Water</span>: No longer causes any threat.</li></ul>
