    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">DRUID</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Druids will receive a fair share of number adjustments aimed at improving performance, as well as quality of life changes for the betterment of day to day play. <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">You can now shift between Druid forms without having to shift out of it first.<br>
<br>
<span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To provide a more fluid way of changing between forms, we're enabling the function to change forms while already being shapeshifted. This was already more or less possible through macro play but we want to level the playing field this way.</i></span></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ancient Brutality:</span> Now only requires two talent points. Energy granted increased from 2/3/4 Energy to 5/10 Energy. Rage generation after a successful dodge changed from 1/2/3 Rage to 2/4 Rage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We were quite restrained with the Energy regeneration offered by Ancient Brutality before. To aid non-shifting druids, we're upping its power substantially, allowing them to gain a more powerful way to regenerate Energy. Additionally, Bear druids will gain more Rage after dodging an attack, making the Dodge stat a tad more attractive.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Claw:</span> Increased the weapon damage of Rank 5 by 5%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Shred:</span> Increased the weapon damage of Rank 6 by 5%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rake:</span> Increased base damage and damage over time effect of Rank 4 by 5%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’ve observed that the combo point generating Cat Form abilities could do with a small boost in power. This grants Cat druids a small edge in their single target niche.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Predatory Strikes:</span> Now increases total Attack Power by 3/6/10% instead of granting Attack Power equal to 50/100/150% of your level.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This talent was quite static in its functionality, capped at Level 60 with a bonus of 90 Attack Power. Changing it to a total increase of Attack Power enables druids to scale even further from several Attack Power sources, as well as main stats.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mark and Gift of the Wild:</span> Now castable in Moonkin Form.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To put Moonkin Form in line with its other humanoid shapeshift form, the Tree of Life form, we’re permitting Moonkin druids to buff their fellow compatriots without leaving their feathery costume.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Balance Tier 3 (6 Set Bonus):</span> Can no longer be resisted.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This effect was falsely able to be resisted.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Owlkin Frenzy:</span> Pushback reduction is now always 30% instead of scaling with talent tiers. Cooldown now scales with talent tiers, now only triggering once every 30/25/20 seconds instead of being 25 seconds flat.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Following our observation, we’ve noticed players were taking this talent with simply one point in investment, which didn’t really fit the intention we had with this talent. To remedy this, we’re changing it to allow for the maximum pushback reduction up front, while making spending more talent points into it more worthwhile.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hurricane:</span> Cooldown reduced from 30 seconds to 10 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’re aiming to have Hurricane be a more frequent tool for area damage with this change.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nature's Focus:</span> Removed Wrath from the description of the talent as it never actually affected it.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: As Wrath is now part of Guidance of the Dream, we’re removing this redundant part of the tooltip that slipped past us.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Feral Combat Tier 2.5 (3 Set):</span> Now also reduces the Energy cost of Shred by 3.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Since our approach to Feral Cat has been shifted from its first iteration, we’re including Shred into the energy reduction of this set bonus to grant it more flexibility in its utility.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Eclipse:</span> Arcane and Nature damage bonus increased from 25% to 30%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: It came to our attention that in some cases ignoring the capstone talent of the Balance Tree yielded equal results in performance, which is something we were not anticipating. To strengthen our design vision, we’re adding a small buff to Eclipse to make using it more rewarding.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">MAGE</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Mage is currently in quite a good state, so these changes will primarily aim to improve Quality of Life and solve a few minor issues mages have to deal with such as being reliant on a set bonus to properly utilize Arcane Power, mana issues and smoothing out Hot Streak-Pyroblast usage with Fire Mage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Rupture:</span> Base damage reduced for lower ranks, being reduced by 10% for ranks 1-4 and by 5% for rank 5. Rank 6 is unchanged.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Pyroblast:</span> Reduced global cooldown from 1.5 seconds to 1 second.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This was done to prevent Pyroblast from clipping your global cooldown when its casted with maximum stacks of Hot Streak, removing any friction when using it.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flash Freeze:</span> No longer activates on temporary immunities such as Free Action Potion or Blessing of Freedom.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change is primarily aimed at Player versus Player interactions, removing the possibility of being punished for using immunities to slow and root effects when fighting against a Frost Mage.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Dampen Magic:</span> Spell damage taken reduction increased from 2% to 3%, healing taken reduction increased from 1% to 2%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Amplify Magic:</span> Healing taken bonus increased from 2% to 3%, spell damage taken bonus increased from 1% to 2%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The original values for these effects after our rework ended up way too weak for practical usage even with their Arcane Attunement buffed versions, so we're giving them a boost to fit better into their roles.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Power:</span> Haste granted reduced from 35% to 30%, mana drained reduced from 2% to 1%, mana regeneration penalty reduced from 75% to 50%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Mage Tier 3 (6 Set):</span> No longer removes the mana regeneration penalty.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Arcane Power ended up being too taxing to use after our initial rework, constantly posing the risk of blowing up without a specific set bonus which also ended up feeling mandatory to use as Arcane Power is a major part of an Arcane Mage power. For this reason we've relaxed the mana drain and penalty on the base ability and removed the mana renegeration reduction effect from the set bonus, which should help make gear loadouts less reliant on this effect especially with the release of Tier 3.5.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fireball:</span> Reduced the mana costs of the following ranks:<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 12): 65 -&gt; 60<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 18): 95 -&gt; 85<br>
    Rank 5 (Level 24): 140 -&gt; 120<br>
    Rank 6 (Level 30): 185 -&gt; 160<br>
    Rank 7 (Level 36): 220 -&gt; 190<br>
    Rank 8 (Level 42): 260 -&gt; 220<br>
    Rank 9 (Level 48): 305 -&gt; 245<br>
    Rank 10 (Level 54): 350 -&gt; 265<br>
    Rank 11 (Level 60): 395 -&gt; 275<br>
    Rank 12 (Level 60/Book): 410 -&gt; 295<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flamestrike:</span> Reduced the mana costs of the following ranks:<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 24): 330 -&gt; 250<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 32): 490 -&gt; 360<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 40): 650 -&gt; 470<br>
    Rank 5 (Level 48): 815 -&gt; 580<br>
    Rank 6 (Level 56): 990 -&gt; 680<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Fire Mages quite struggle with mana even with the help of talents such as Master of Elements and tend to feel reliant on them, for this reason we're reducing the mana cost of the two aforementioned spells.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">HUNTER</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    These batch of changes are primarily aimed at Survival, opening different ways of gearing with support for dual wielding, reducing the mana strain fire traps have on their rotation and slightly reducing their leveling proficiency.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mongoose Bite:</span> Reduced flat damage values by around 40%:<br>
    Rank 1 (Level 16): 25 -&gt; 15.<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 30): 45 to 25.<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 44): 75 to 45.<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 58): 115 to 70.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: These reductions are primarily aimed at leveling to reduce the speed at which Survival Hunters kill at that stage and won't affect endgame much as its targeted towards the non-scaling part of the ability.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Untamed Trapper:</span> Now also reduces the mana cost of your Fire traps by 20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While this capstone talent made fire traps an integral part of the Survival Hunter rotation it didn't accomodate for this as the fire trap mana costs ended up being too high when used on cooldown, this change should help alleviate this issue.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Savage Strikes:</span> Now also increases the damage of your offhand weapon by 13/25%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Addition of a boost to your offhand weapon damage aims to make dual-wield a just as viable alternative to two-handed Survival Hunters.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">PALADIN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Paladins continue to perform well across all three specializations in both raid and dungeon environments. This update focuses on improving underperforming talents and abilities while introducing minor quality-of-life improvements and parity adjustments. Certain aspects of the Paladin toolkit remain under evaluation, with additional changes planned for future updates.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hammer of Wrath:</span> No longer resets your swing timer.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Hammer of Wrath has been significantly underutilized in PvE due to its current mechanics. This adjustment enhances the execute phase, making the ability more viable and rewarding to use.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessing of Salvation:</span> Threat reduction reduced from 30% to 25%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Current tank threat generation significantly outpaces DPS output. Reducing the effectiveness of Blessing of Salvation restores the importance of active threat management during combat.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vindication:</span> Damage reduction increased from 1/2/3% to 3/6/9%. The tooltip has been updated to clarify that boss enemies are unaffected.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Vindication previously offered insufficient value for talent investment. This buff makes it a more appealing choice, particularly for solo play and PvP engagements.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Seal of Righteousness:</span> Spell power scaling increased to 0.092 * Weapon Speed for One-Handed Weapons and 0.128 * Weapon Speed for Two-Handed Weapons.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Hybrid builds utilizing Seal of Righteousness have consistently underperformed compared to Seal of Command. This change aims to bridge the gap and provide a more competitive alternative.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Judgement of Righteousness:</span> Now properly benefits from melee critical strike and hit chance instead of spell critical strike and hit chance.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The previous interaction caused inconsistency with Judgement of Command, leading to confusion. This update unifies the mechanics of these Judgements for improved reliability and ease of play.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Eye for an Eye</span> has swapped positions with <span style="color:#ffbf40">Two-Handed Weapon Specialization</span> in the talent tree.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The Retribution talent tree contained awkward pathing, particularly in the fourth row. Moving Two-Handed Weapon Specialization down improves accessibility to key talents and enhances the leveling experience.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vengeance:</span> No longer applies its threat reduction if Righteous Fury is active.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Retribution Paladins faced significant drawbacks when off-tanking due to the innate threat reduction of Vengeance. This change ensures that no talent actively hinders a Paladin’s ability to perform their role, improving off-tanking viability and creating new build opportunities within the Protection tree.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reckoning:</span> Proc chance increased from 5/10/15/20/25% to 10/20/30/40/50%. The tooltip has been clarified.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Reckoning has struggled to provide sufficient value for the talent points invested. This improvement makes it a more viable and impactful option for Protection Paladins.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Light:</span> Reduced spellpower coefficient from 71.4% to 20% for Rank 1.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">PRIEST</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    These changes primarily aim to improve Discipline Priest's personal damage and support capabilities and to improve Shadow Priest's Player versus Player environment power as the changes brought with the initial class changes release ended up being harsher than we've intended it to be.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Smite:</span> Spellpower scaling increased by about 5% for all ranks.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Discipline is slightly underperforming compared to Shadow, so we're slightly boosting its damage to match the performance of its fellow supporty-damage specialization.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Chastise:</span> Effect duration increased from 6 seconds (Non-critical) and 9 seconds (Critical) to 8 seconds (Non-critical) and 12 seconds (Critical), attack and casting speed boost increased from 10/13/15% to 13/17/20%, cooldown increased from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Chastise ended up struggling to be worth its global cooldown.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Pain Spike:</span> Spellpower scaling increased from 25% to 43%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The earlier scaling reduction on Pain Spike ended up being more harsh than we've intended with it compounding with the cooldown increase, so we're increasing its spellpower scaling back up.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    Swapped the talent locations of <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spell Warding</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessed Concentration</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Shadow Priests struggled quite a bit with build diversity since we've moved Blessed Concentration to the Holy talent tree. We've moved its location to make the latter talent more accessible and enable a wider variety builds in the Player versus Player environment.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Enlighten:</span> Chance to trigger from heals reduced from 15% to 10%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While Enlighten is a powerful option for Discipline Priests and their support capabilities, its usage by Holy Priests ended up heavily outweighing the usage of Holy Champion, so we're dialing back its proc chance to give the Holy Champion some time in the spotlight.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">SHAMAN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Shaman's popularity as a class keeps growing as it attracts more players who are interested in the damage-dealer aspects of the class and players interested in its benefits as a healer. These small changes reflect our contentedness with the current evolution of the entire class' design over the past months as we believe this mini-patch did not warrant any substantial changes to the design of the class. Though we are aware of areas on which to improve, understand that homogenizing the class with design aspects and roles covered by other classes and their relative specializations is absolutely not in our objectives. We are continuously looking at properly-shared player feedback and have taken extensive note of them, with the above comment in mind we are confident expectations will be met in an elegant manner.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Elemental Focus:</span> Mana cost reduction now also affects Stormstrike and Lightning Strike.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lightning Strike:</span> Cooldown reduced from 10 seconds to 9 seconds. The nature part of the ability now gains damage equal to 5% of your spellpower.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: With these changes, we hope to address some of Enhancement's mana issues and its overbearing reliance on classes capable of providing boosts to mana regeneration, as their absence often signifies a drastic drop in gameplay quality and flow over longer encounters, while remaining a critical point of levelling as the spec. The reduction to Lightning Strike's cooldown, though minor, should directly increase its role as both a more efficient and engaging contributor to Enhancement's damage dealer and mana regeneration role.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bloodlust:</span> Attack and casting speed granted to party members on critical strike increased from 5% to 8% and its duration is increased from 5 seconds to 6 seconds, attack and casting speed granted to the caster increased from 15% to 20%. The attack and casting speed granted to party members on critical strike is no longer applied to the caster itself.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: After closer analysis from the team, we've come to the conclusion that the buff to the party members feels minor enough to warrant a small increment. We're generally satisfied with Enhancement's solo performance and would like to not magnify its group support performance further in order to strike a balance between the group bonuses brought forth by the other specializations.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fire Nova Totem and Grounding Totem:</span> Now trigger the global cooldown.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment:These totems are de facto powerful abilities which by design already warrant a cooldown. Given their impact on normal gameplay, we've decided to have them trigger the global cooldown to spur a more thought-out use from the playerbase, which we're sure will quickly adapt and hone their skill accordingly. We are aware of how enjoyable it is to have full creative agency when it comes to setting totems and are confident this change will not restrain it.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Enhancement Tier 3 (6 Set Bonus):</span> Duration increased from 5 seconds to 10 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">WARLOCK</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Warlock is getting further adjustments and design corrections across its many specializations. These range from carefully distributing power to the underperforming abilities to reasonable containment of heavy outliers. Affliction Warlock should now be able to better keep up with other specializations, namely on trash encounters. On the other hand, deep Demonology talents funneled too much power into the Warlock, so the focus is being shifted more towards the demons.[/o]<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Resilient Shadows:</span> Increased dispel resistance from 3/6/9% to 5/10/15%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Malediction:</span> Now also causes your Curse of Recklessness, Curse of Elements and Curse of Shadows to apply your highest rank of Curse of Agony, if there isn't one. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To combat lengthy setup time during Dungeon trash encounters, which is Affliction Warlock's main pain point, we're making this talent more aggressive.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Siphon Life:</span> Total spell power scaling has been increased from 50% to 100%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Dark Harvest:</span> Now increases haste by 30% instead of 20% and resets its cooldown if its target dies during its channel.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Funnel:</span> Now causes the Warlock to pay 30% of transferred health or mana. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Sacrifice:</span> Now removed when you enslave a demon. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The goal behind this change is to encourage more strategic choices for deep Demonology, when it comes to controlling demons, instead of having a simple numbers increase for the "cooldown spec". Controlling a demon goes against the Demonic Sacrifice's precursor talent, Soul Entrapment, too. We'll keep looking into finding a way to make this talent unique and rewarding.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Demonologist (Infernal):</span> Healing reduction reduced from 75% to 50%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Demonologist (Felguard):</span> Damage increase reduced from 20% to 10%.<br>

    <hr>

    Imp's <span style="color:#ffbf40">Firebolt</span> ability has now the following scaling with spell power:<br>
    Rank 1: 10%<br>
    Rank 2: 15%<br>
    Rank 3: 20%<br>
    Rank 4. 25%<br>
    Rank 5. 30%<br>
    Rank 6: 35%<br>
    Rank 7. 40%<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We will be closely monitoring Imp's power level and be ready to provide future adjustments.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Legion Strike (Felguard):</span> Now deals 50% weapon damage with a 4 sec cooldown instead of 130% weapon damage with a 6 sec cooldown. Felguard can now crit with all attacks. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While the damage got scaled down more than the cooldown, keep in mind that Felguard will get a notable power increase through critical strikes.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    Related Item Change:<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">The Black Book</span> trinket buff is now removed if the trinket is unequipped.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">ROGUE</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    These changes are primarily aimed at the Assassination specialization, reworking Deadly Throw to be a properly viable abilty with its own identity and reworking Throwing Weapon Specializationn alongside it, improving poison related talents and improving Subtlety Rogue's personal damage output via a boost to Hemorrhage damage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hemorrhage:</span> Weapon damage increased from 100% to 110%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Deadly Throw:</span> Reworked:<br>
    - No longer spends combo points.<br>
    - Energy cost increased from 35 to 40.<br>
    - Now deals 100% weapon damage.<br>
    - Has a shared cooldown with Kick and has the same cooldown as Kick.<br>
    - Now interrupts the target for 3 seconds baseline.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Throwing Weapon Specialization:</span> Now has a 50/100% chance to apply your off-hand weapon poison instead of an increasing proc chance for a 3 second interrupt per combo point spent. Range increase remains the same.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Deadly Throw has been the underdog of finisher abilities for a long time, so we're giving it a complete makeover, making it an alternative to Kick for cases you can't reach a caster in time with a slightly shorter interrupt duration. Additionally, Throwing Specialization was reworked to interact with your poisons, as most talents in the Assassination tree do, allowing you to apply poisons from range which should provide a lot of utility.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    All Warrior specializations are currently in a strong position, with each seeing consistent play across all forms of content. We are pleased with the overall performance of Warriors but will closely monitor their impact in the Tower of Karazhan. Given Warriors’ well-documented scaling potential, the new raid loot may further enhance their power.<br>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Concussion Blow: </span> Stun duration increased from 2 seconds to 3 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The stun duration reduction that came with the cooldown reduction for Concussive Blow ended up making it too short to properly utilize, so we're slightly increasing it so it can be an useful tool for both threat generation and crowd control.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Pummel:</span> Now applies a normal 50% movement speed reduction instead of a Daze effect and its application chance is increased from 25/50% to 50/100%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While we've liked the interaction of the slow applied by Improved Pummel being more sticky against players, it proved to be problematic so we're changing it to a normal slow and guaranteeing its application when fully talented to make up for this change.</i></span></div>
