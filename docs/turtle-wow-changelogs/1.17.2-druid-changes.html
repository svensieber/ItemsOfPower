    Druids were among the few classes receiving small updates throughout the years following our first round of Class Changes. The ability to equip polearms and the addition of Feral Attack Power on many of the more undesirable weapons found on Azeroth were a great boon to their itemization. While already receiving many alterations before, the Druid class and all its specializations still had some pain points that were in need of some ironing out.<br>
    <br>
    Starting with their base spells and abilities, there have been many voices lamenting the power of druid's two Area of Effect spells: Hurricane and Tranquility. <br>
    <br>
    The former has a very useful attack speed slow component attached to it, yet its long cooldown and meager damage output held it back in fights with multiple enemies. In order to rebalance its power, we removed the attack speed slow and moved it to the Balance tree as a talent. This allowed us to reduce Hurricane's cooldown by half, while also strengthening its scaling with the Spell Power stat.<br>
    <br>
    Tranquility is an iconic spell from Warcraft 3. As the ultimate ability of the Keeper of the Grove hero unit, its World of Warcraft counterpart sadly does not live up to its legacy. More often than not it is not beneficial to use this spell when faced with a lot of incoming damage, as the other healing spells offer a stronger rescue potential. To grant Tranquility an effect worthy of its origin and visual, it will now affect all raid members in close range of the druid, at a significantly decreased healing power and increased cooldown. Only Restoration druids will be able to unlock Tranquility‘s true potential.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">BASELINE CHANGES</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    Druids will now be able to undergo a challenging and expensive questline to learn the <span style="color:#ffbf40">Swift Travel Form</span>. This form takes on a set appearance and has the same functionalities as any other epic mount, meaning it cannot be used in combat or indoors and grants a 100% movement speed bonus. To start this questline, accept 'Mount Hyjal In Turmoil' at the Druid trainer Loganaar in Moonglade.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Manual Crowd Pummeler</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Battery-Powered Crowd Pummeler</span> now increases swing speed by 20% instead of increasing attack speed by 50%, meaning the haste amount is reduced from 50% to 20% and no longer functions in shapeshifting forms and the ability now has a 20 minute cooldown. Attack speed increased from 2.0 to 2.9, the DPS remains the same.<br>

    <hr>
    All ranks of <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tranquility</span> have been reworked. Here is an example of the new Rank 4: Regenerates all raid members within 30 yards for 87 every second for 10 seconds. The druid must channel to maintain the spell. <br>

    <ul><li>Increased cooldown from 5 to 30 minutes.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Doubled the mana cost.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Healing tick rate changed from 2 seconds to 1 second.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Baseline threat removed.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Now affects all members of your raid instead of just your group.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Ranks 1 to 4 now last for 4, 6, 8 and 10 seconds respectively.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    New Spell: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ferocious Bite </span>(Rank 1) <br>
    Learned at Level 24<br>
    Finishing move that causes damage per combo point and converts each extra point of energy into 1 additional damage.  Damage is increased by your Attack Power.
    <ul><li>1 point  : 35-51 damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>2 points: 67-83 damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>3 points: 99-115 damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>4 points: 131-147 damage</li></ul>

    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Savage Bite currently acts as a way to spend excess rage without any other purpose. To balance out the removed dependency of the Manual Crowd Pummeler, this ability will now cause additional threat.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Frenzied Regeneration</span>: Healing formula has been changed for all 3 ranks to the following: Heals the Druid by converting 10 points of rage per second into health. Each point of rage equals to 6/7/8% of your total stamina. Cooldown increased to 6 minutes.

    Druids will now be able to use consumable items in their Cat and Bear forms.

    In the past, the Balance specialization has provided their fair share of indispensable utility and buffs. While highly beneficial to their group, the Moonkin itself suffered in a few select areas, both during leveling and endgame content. We set it our goal to uplift Balance druids and offer an engaging playstyle to alleviate the hurdles standing in the way of our druid players. This is done in part by allowing their two Damage over Time spells to augment their main spells Wrath and Starfire, creating a rotation between maintaining Insect Swarm and Moonfire and alternating Wrath and Starfire.<br>
    <br>

    Restoration Druids are in a great spot at the moment. Their talents allow for a variety of playstyles, be it Moonglow, Regrowth or Tree of Life - there is a little bit of everything for everyone. With the addition of the Tree of Life Form, we tried to steer Restoration Druids into the niche of the ‘healing over time’ healer; and would like to continue that path. However, there is an obstacle in that path we need to overcome: the anti synergy of having more than one restoration druid in your group. We did not want Healing over Time spells to stack, as we deemed this approach to be too powerful. Instead we opted for a way to allow other druids to overwrite already applied healing over time effects and cause a direct heal.<br>
    <br>
    New Passive Spell:<span style="color:#ffbf40"> Efflorescence</span><br>

    Any Druid's Regrowth is applicable for this effect.

    There are a few issues Feral Combat Druids are facing right now. The biggest contender is their relative dependency on the Manual Crowd Pummeler. Its item effect greatly amplifies damage for both forms and subsequently the threat gain for bears. To alleviate their need for this item for optimal threat, we introduced a few adjustments to abilities and talents. Furthermore, we lifted the restriction of feral forms not being able to use consumable items such as potions, healthstones and similar. A new defensive spell, Barkskin (Feral), will help them survive the more risky and unpredictable situations during combat. <br>
    <br>
    For the Cat Form Druids, we’re offering a way to utilize the player’s bleed abilities, by making them interact with their main attack skills. Additionally, a new early rank of Ferocious Bite at Level 24 will give druids more options during their leveling journey.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Open Wounds</span> (Row 2) (3 Ranks)<br>
    Increases the damage of Claw by 10/20/30% if the target is afflicted by Rake. In addition, your Rip ability increases your Claw damage by 3/4/5% per combo point spent for 15 sec.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Feline Swiftness</span>: Name changed to Feral Swiftness and now grants its dodge bonus to Bear and Dire Bear form as well.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blood Frenzy</span>: Increased attack speed bonus from 12% to 30%. Now generates 10 rage when using Enrage, as a bug formerly made it generate double the intended amount.
    <hr>
    New Talent:<span style="color:#ffbf40"> Feral Adrenaline</span> (Row 5) (3 Ranks)<br>
    Suffering a physical critical strike while in Bear, Dire Bear or Cat Form increases your chance to dodge by 15/30/45% until you dodge the next physical attack against you.<br>
    This effect can only occur once every 30 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Critical strikes are one of the many dangers bear druids face when tanking powerful foes. To alleviate the peril after suffering a critical strike, Feral Adrenaline will offer a small buffer window for healers and the tank to react to sudden damage spikes.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ancient Brutality</span> (Row 6) (3 Ranks)<br>
    Dodging an attack while in Bear or Dire Bear Form imbues you with the spirit of the Ancients, returning 5/10/15% of your damage dealt as healing and generating 1/2/3 rage per second for 5 sec. This effect can only occur once every 6 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Although dodging is one of the few ways for druids to avoid damage, it is not as desired as a stat as one would assume. While blocking generates rage for warriors, dodging does not for druids. Still, they cannot avoid accumulating this stat due to how Agility grants additional dodge chance. This talent will allow druids to gain benefit from it by generating rage on successful dodges.</i></span><br>
