    <br>
    <br>
    Greetings! Since our start on the class balancing journey we’ve been gathering your feedback and insights. <br>
    <br>
    While we're happy with the first batch of class changes, they were done under a much more conservative mindset with minor changes, and so vanilla's unbalanced state was still very much felt. Due to this, it fell short on fixing the issues for some of the specializations and failing to make enough impactful changes. It has now been 2 years since those changes and we’re finally taking a deeper dive into balancing and building a solid foundation that’ll serve as the core for all specializations for years to come. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>These changes aren’t the final word on class updates. We’ll continue making balance adjustments and potentially soft reworks if a specialization’s changes don’t play out as expected.</b></span><br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Please note that numbers are subject to change along the way throughout 1.17.2. If they do, we will notify you accordingly.</strong><br>
    <br>
    With that said, we’re now ready to unveil the preliminary changelog for the second batch of Class Changes, coming with <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">Patch 1.17.2: Tower of Karazhan</strong></span>. This changelog will be updated if any further changes and tweaks are made.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">GAMEPLAY CHANGES</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    The <span style="color:#ffbf40">Weapon Skill</span> formula has been altered.<br>
    <br>
    In short this means that any form of extra Weapon Skill now affects your character linearly and no longer works with awkward breakpoints causing Weapon Skill on items or spells to change in value based on your character's amount.<br>
    <br>
    You can now acquire books that grant +5 skill increases to specific weapon types via new quests.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i></i></span>
    <ul><li><span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Fighting bosses and creatures 3 levels higher than you no longer applies a 1% hit suppression, so the hit cap against them has been effectively moved from 9% to 8%. This also means that the "soft cap" of 305 skill that used to counteract the 1% hit suppression, no longer exists.</i></span></li> </ul>
    <ul><li><span style="opacity:0.7"><i>In addition, the benefit provided by skill from 300 to 304 and 305 to 308 has been smoothed out, each point of skill now providing the exact same benefit of 0.2% hit chance and 2% reduced glancing damage penalty.</i></span></li> </ul>
    <ul><li><span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Reduced the amount of weapon skill granted by racials from +5 to +3.</i></span></li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Throwing Weapons</span> now spend durability when used instead of consuming a stack of your item. <br>
    For this reason the following changes have been made:
    <ul><li>The buy and sell prices have been increased.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Throwing weapons are now disenchantable.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Quests that give throwing weapons now give only one on completion.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Creatures that drop throwing weapons now only drop one.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Vendors that sell throwing weapons now sell one every purchase.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Throwing weapons have higher durability depending on their quality, meaning they can be used for longer without repairing.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Throwing weapons now only stack to one.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Throwing weapons currently in possession will be updated retroactively upon patch release.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Goblin Brainwashing Device</span> now incurs a personal 10 minute cooldown after use. This cooldown persists through death and continues to count while offline.
    <hr>
    You can no longer move a player between raid groups if they are in combat.
    <hr>
    Removed spells that are learned above level 6 from starting zone class trainers. These were primarily introduced in the first iteration of Class Changes by accident.
    <hr>
    Abilities that were changed to be a baseline ability or to be a talent learned ability in the first and second batches of class changes have had training prices updates to reflect that change.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tea With Sugar</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nordanaar Herbal Tea</span> now grant 525-875 health and 810-1350 mana instead of 1050-1750 health and mana. These items now stack to 20 instead of 5. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Note: This change allows Demonic and Dark Runes to be a proper alternative to the tea consumables, granting more mana at the cost of health compared to less mana and small amounts of healing.</i></span>
    <hr>
    The <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bow Specialization</span> granted by Tome of Expertise: Bows in Hyjal is now retired. This means:
    <ul><li>The book no longer functions and is removed from all players.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The quest is no longer available and removed from all players.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Bow Specialization is now removed from everyone that has learned it with this method. Everyone that has completed the quest will be refunded 50 Bright Dream Shards. This does not affect races that have Bow Specialization as a normal racial such as Trolls and High Elves.</li></ul>

    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">RACIAL CHANGES</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    These changes aim to reduce the gaps between racials and how much power they contribute to your character, especially in cases where some race-class combos are much more dominant compared to other races. While we tune down severe examples of these, we’ve also added new racials, buffed or added new functionality to old racials of underperforming races that increase power, which was also done to races that got affected by the global nerf to weapon skill racials. While making these changes we have focused on making sure that all racials remain flavorful and fit their race.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">General</strong></span>
    <ul><li>Reduced the amount of weapon skill granted by racials from +5 to +3.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">Human</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Perception</span> now also grants 2% increased physical and spell critical strike chance for the duration.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">The Human Spirit</span> now allows 5% of your Mana regeneration to continue while casting.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">Dwarf</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Stoneform</span> now reduces physical damage taken by 5% instead of increasing armor by 10%.</li></ul>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">Night Elf</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Quickness</span> now also increases your attack and casting speed and movement speed by 1%.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Note: Unlike other similar movement speed increasing effects, the movement speed granted by this racial additively stacks with other movement speed increasing effects.</i></span></li></ul>
    <hr>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Shadowmeld</span> now persists for 2 seconds after being canceled or moving. Cooldown increased from 10 seconds to 3 minutes.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">Gnome</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Escape Artist</span>’s cooldown has been increased from 1 minute to 1.5 minutes.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Resistance</span> removed.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New racial: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Disassembler</span>: Damage dealt versus Mechanicals increased by 5%.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">High Elf</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Quel’dorei Meditation</span> has seen a small rework:
        <ul><li>Now activates after a 1.5 second cast instead of being a 5 second channel.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Now generates 10% total mana, 20 Rage or 50 Energy over 5 seconds instead of 4% maximum mana, 6 Rage and 13 Energy every second.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Cooldown reduced from 6 minutes to 3 minutes.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>You are now given a specific version of the racial that generates only your resource instead of a general one that generates them all. This means that if you’re a mana user, your racial will only generate mana, if you’re a Rogue it will only generate Energy and if you’re a Warrior it will only generate Rage.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Warrior Version: You are now considered in combat for the duration, this is to prevent rage decay while the racial is active.</li></ul></li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Resistance</span> removed.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New racial: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Swiftness of the Rangers</span>: Agility increased by 2%.</li></ul>
    <hr>

    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Blood Fury</span> now increases your Attack Power and damage dealt by magical spells and effects by an amount equal to your level for 15 sec. and reduces healing effects on you by 25% for 25 sec.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Hardiness</span> now reduces the duration of Stun effects by 15% instead of increasing your chance to resist Stun effects by 25%.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">Troll</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Berserking</span> now grants between 10% - 15% attack and casting speed depending on how badly you are hurt instead of between 10% - 30%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Regeneration</span> now increases health regeneration by 20% instead of 10% and allows 25% of total health regeneration to continue in combat instead of 10%.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40"><strong class="text-strong">Undead</strong></span>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Will of the Forsaken</span>’s duration has been reduced from 5 seconds to 4 seconds and it can’t be activated while under crowd control.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Shadow Resistance</span> removed.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New racial: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vengeance</span>: Damage against Humanoids and Undead is increased by 2%.</li></ul>

    <span style="color:#4bd3ff"><strong class="text-strong">UPDATES | Dated: October 21 2024</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Racials in Vanilla have always been a tricky topic. On one hand, they encourage diversity and avoid homogenization by having races excel in niches through unique traits, this fits Vanilla flavor perfectly. On the other hand however it is common knowledge that the Horde has always had the upper hand when it comes to combat racials, especially in PvP. Our changes to these Racials sought to remedy this issue by keeping Racials unique and flavorful to their race while evening out the power of the outliers. That being said, after extensive discussions and player feedback we realize that some Racials were hit too hard while others got a little less love than they deserve.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Will of the Forsaken</span>: Duration reduced from 4 to 3 seconds. Cooldown increased from 2 minutes to 2.5 minutes. Can now be used while under crowd control to break out as before.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vengeance</span>: Now only affects non-player Humanoids.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blood Fury</span>: Attack Power bonus increased from 100% of your level to 200% of your level, no longer part of the global cooldown.

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Shadowmeld</span>: Cooldown reduced from 3 minutes to 1 minute.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">War Stomp</span>: Duration increased from 1.5 to 2 seconds, cooldown increased from 2 minutes to 2.5 minutes.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Exit Strategy</span>: No longer slows the user after sprinting.</div>
