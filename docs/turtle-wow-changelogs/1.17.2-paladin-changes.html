    <br>
    The design of the Paladin class in Vanilla is often considered unfinished, with urban legends (which may or may not be true) suggesting that the lead designers specifically disliked the class. Just before release, both Crusader Strike and Holy Strike were removed. In raids, the main role of Paladins was to bless each member individually every 5 minutes, as Greater Blessings didn't yet exist. Blizzard recognized their mistake and how boring this playstyle was in Patch 1.9, with the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, when Greater Blessings were added. However, the base design of the class was still lacking, and Paladins in any role other than healer were considered very weak compared to other classes, making levelling incredibly dull.<br>
    <br>
    Holy Strike, in its beta form, was restored to Turtle during the server's early days when the client was an unmodified 1.12 version. At the time, this seemed like a good idea, and while it addressed many Paladin issues, it was also quite unbalanced in scenarios with percentage damage increases or in player combat. Crusader Strike, added in the first batch of class changes, was also a restored beta ability, but it too suffered from fundamental issues, resulting in an unrewarding gameplay loop of spamming downranked spells to force chance on hit effects from weapons and armor.<br>
    <br>
    We decided to redesign these abilities from the ground up, offering a new, unified, and improved gameplay experience for all specializations. The new strikes are now a core part of the rotation, regardless of your role. Additionally, the baseline Paladin receives numerous quality-of-life improvements, such as a baseline taunt, increased blessing duration, and the conversion of certain Blessings into Hand spells which do not remove your normal buff Blessings.<br>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crusader Strike </span><br>
    Reworked to the following:<br>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Zeal</span> increases your attack and casting speed by 3%.<br>
    <br>
    (Instant attack, 6 Second Cooldown which is shared with Holy Strike, the additional damage has a 33% Spell Power scaling coefficient, reduced for ranks below level 20.)<br>
    (This strike can trigger Judgement effects and refreshes its duration. Does not proc Seals.)<br>
    <br>
    Damage and Mana Cost Values:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 8): 80% Weapon Damage + 31 Damage, 20 Mana</li> </ul>

    Strike your target for X to Y Holy damage, restoring Z health and Z mana to you and your party.<br>
    <br>
    (Instant attack, 6 Second Cooldown which is shared with Crusader Strike, damage has a 43% Spell Power scaling coefficient and the healing has a 5% healing power scaling coefficient, both reduced for ranks below level 20.)<br>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Holy Strike, as mentioned above, has always been a problematic ability. It was double dipping from Vengeance and all other percentage increases. It was piercing armor. With how bursty pvp in vanilla is, this was a very feel bad ability for the person on the other side of the screen.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, as an ability used against creatures it was quite underwhelming. There was little tactical decision when you should use it, and overall it was quite boring as a spell, being just a copy of heroic strike. It was *something* to press, but it lacked meaningful synergy with the rest of the kit or any talents.<br>
<br>
As for Crusader Strike - its low damage made it very low impact ability on press, and it lacked the power and feeling core rotational ability should have. It also made paladins global cooldown capped and spammy, because if you had a free gcd, you would just press it, which was rather uninteresting. <br>
<br>
That in itself was not the biggest problem of the ability. Its biggest issue was how it interacted with certain buffs provided by consumables and more so, shamans, such as flametongue and windfury. Playing paladin without these external buffs felt like playing an incomplete spec, and with them, paladin’s damage would get out of control quickly, making it a balance nightmare.<br>
<br>
We believe new iterations of these abilities should provide paladin with a more balanced, tactical gameplay in combat, where you use strikes accordingly to your need, while also limiting their power in pvp combat. <br>
Moreover, once you look at the talent trees, you can notice that every tree has a 5 pointer talent that enhances these abilities, making them more useful for the respective specs. </i></span>

    New Ability: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hand of Reckoning</span><br>
    Taunts the target to attack you, causing a high amount of threat.<br>
    (10 Second Cooldown, 10 Yard Range, 90 Mana Cost)<br>
    Learned at level 10.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Experiment with Judgement of Justice being a taunt was a worthy one, but it missed the mark in a few places. While it gave paladins a taunt that basically couldn’t miss, it was also very clunky, as it was basically using up two global cooldowns and a lot of mana to get back to normal rotation after taunting. We have decided to give paladins a baseline taunt, working in the same way as druid and warrior one, with the added benefit of talenting into additional hit in protection tree to give Paladins back their old taunt niche.</i></span>
    <hr>
    Added a new rank for <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flash of Light</span>:<br>
    Heals a friendly target for 428 to 493. <br>
    (180 Mana Cost)<br>
    Learned at level 60.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Judgement of the Crusader</span>: Reverted to its original behavior.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Judgement of the Crusader was in a weird place after our first batch of class changes, when the addition of Crusader Strike made the ability almost useless. New version, added in a patch after between the batches of class changes, was poorly thought out and led to multiple issues with weapon chance on hit effects, where individual weapon effects had to be nerfed or changed just to accommodate the ability's existence. This proved to be too hard to design and balance around, that's why we are removing forced weapon chance on hit abilities from it, as cool as the ability is. To ease the minds of all concerned Discipline Priests and Retribution Paladins: it should be much easier to keep the holy damage increase on targets now, thanks to the strikes refreshing judgements.</i></span>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessing of Freedom</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessing of Sacrifice</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessing of Protection</span> are now <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hand of Freedom</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hand of Sacrifice</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hand of Protection</span>.

    <br>
    Holy is considered to be the most complete paladin specialization, and in good hands can perform quite well. However, when it comes to raw throughput, it is the weakest healer overall, as it suffers from poor scaling. Its main strength, mana efficiency, is not as important on Turtle as there are better and more efficient ways of gaining mana than in 1.12.<br>
    Moreover, Holy Paladin lacks identity that would separate it from other healers. Holy Paladin right now is a priest in all but name, and our changes aim to address that, incentivizing holy paladin to increase their throughput and sustain by going into melee range while keeping the old playstyle at similar power level.<br>
    <br>
    Removed: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Blessing of Wisdom</span><br>
    Talent has been removed and its effect has been added to a new talent in the first row of the Retribution talent tree that increases the potency of both Blessing of Might and Wisdom. <br>
    <br>

    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Judgement </span> (Row 2 / 3 Ranks)<br>
    Casting Judgement reduces the cast time of your next Holy Light by 0.3/0.6/1 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: As said before, we want to incentivize Holy Paladins going into melee range. This talent should help with that, reducing the cast time of your most powerful healing spell. </i></span>
    <hr>
    Adjustment: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spiritual Focus</span><br>
    Now requires 2 points instead of 5 points.
    <hr>
    Adjustment: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Seal of Righteousness</span><br>
    Damage increase reduced to 10% from 15%, but now affects total damage (after Spell Power) instead of base damage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We believe this talent will help both protection and spell retribution, allowing their main seal to scale into endgame.</i></span>
    <hr>
    Adjustment: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Illumination</span><br>
    Mana restoration lowered from 20/40/60/80/100% to 12/24/36/48/60% of the base cost of the spell.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Holy Paladins are incredibly mana efficient with their heals compared to other healers, which is problematic when it comes to balancing their healing capabilities. Theoretically they would excel in long fights with high healing requirements, but such fights simply don’t exist in vanilla.<br>
<br>
That’s why we decided to power down their sustain a bit, while increasing their overall healing throughput and healing capabilities. In addition, buffed Seal of Wisdom should provide Holy Paladins with additional mana regeneration, so Holy Paladins willing to stop healing for a while and melee the boss have a way to restore their mana.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ironclad</span> (Row 4 / 2 Ranks)<br>
    Increases your healing power by 1/2% of your Armor contribution from items.<br>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Holy Paladin’s damage right now can be quite bursty at times, thanks to Holy Shock. With the new talents allowing for it to reset, we felt like the ranged burst could become too dangerous. Overall Holy damage should be higher thanks to the new strikes, but will require you to remain in melee.<br>
While we understand that the “shockadin” specialization is beloved by many, it does not fit our vision for the class. </i></span>

    Rework: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Divine Favor</span><br>

    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We felt like the niche of Divine Favor as an emergency critical spell was rather bland and uninteresting, and in most scenarios was just combined with a Holy Shock cast. We believe this talent will be a good way to increase Holy Shock potency passively, while old-style paladin builds can just skip it.</i></span>
    <hr>
    Adjustment: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Power</span><br>
    Now has 3 ranks granting 2/4/6% critical chance to Flash of Light and Holy Light, no longer affecting Holy Shock.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blessed Strikes</span> (Row 6 / 5 Ranks)<br>
    <br>
    Crusader Strike has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to reset the cooldown of your Holy Shock. (after resetting holy shock’s cooldown that way, it will have global cooldown reduced by 1 second)<br>
    Holy Strike healing effect is increased by  30/60/90/120/150%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Both of these talents are meant to push Holy into melee range, either by improving their aoe healing capabilities with Holy Strike, or single target instant healing with Crusader Strike. We hope this will make Holy an engaging healer who has way more options in their arsenal, while playing into paladin melee healer fantasy.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Capstone Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Daybreak</span> (Row 7 / 1 Rank)<br>
    <br>
    Critically healing an ally leaves Daybreak on them for 12 seconds. Daybreak increases healing taken from Flash of Light, Holy Light and Holy Shock by 20% and increases their maximum hit points by 5%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Holy Paladin by design was meant as a healer excelling in single target, tank healing. Unfortunately, current design does not promote it in any way, and people see Holy Paladins as a good single target healer mostly because they can’t do anything else. Their raw single target healing throughput is lower than other healing classes. We hope this talent will help solve this issue, promoting healing same targets by keeping the critical strike buff on them. Moreover this buff provides paladin synergy, making it more worthwhile to bring more Holy Paladins to the raid.</i></span><br>

    Protection compared to 1.12 Vanilla already received a lot of changes on Turtle. While they somewhat helped the specialization to become viable, it was still behind bear and warrior tanks in raiding. While you could do a good amount of threat as a paladin, the setup required was not equal to the rewards.<br>
    Main issue was that Vengeance was almost always the optimal play for raid tanking and deep protection talents were lackluster, which led to people speccing retribution, which was against our intent.<br>
    With these changes we aim to make the sword and board Protection Paladin the optimal way to play a specialization and overall increase its survivability and make gameplay more enjoyable and less reliant on gimmicks.<br>
    <br>
    Adjustment: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Anticipation</span><br>

    <hr>
    Rework: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reckoning</span><br>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Reckoning as it was was purely a joke ability which relied on getting critically struck just like old Redoubt.

    Retribution Paladin number wise is a competitive specialization that has its niche and multiple viable builds. However, we don’t like how it plays and its reliance on Windfury Totem and Flametongue Totem. We also think that items that grant extra elemental damage on attacks being almost required to keep up Vengeance and sustain mana are unhealthy in the long run. Lastly, this specialization suffers from threat issues and a weak capstone talent.<br>
    With this rework, we tried to handle all these concerns, and create a more unified design, but still with multiple viable build and gearing options.<br>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Mana restoration part of this talent has been quite useless, and paladin can now provide this type of support with Holy Strike. However, we recognize the utility this talent possesses for player combat- we will closely monitor paladin matchups against Purge and make Seals undispellable if those matchups prove to be too oppressive.</i></span>

    Rework: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vengeance</span><br>
    Moved to Row 5, Physical and Holy damage bonus reduced from 3/6/9/12/15% to 1/2/3/4/5%, now reduces threat generation by 2/4/6/8/10%, duration increased from 8 seconds to 30 seconds and now stacks up to 3 times.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: 1.12.1 Vengeance is a cool concept, but flawed due to existence of items that add elemental damage to your attacks. We believe it will be healthier to remove some burst and explosiveness from Vengeance in favor for a stacking buff thats easier to keep up.<br>
<br>
In addition, we added threat reduction to Vengeance to combat both Protection Paladins taking this talent and using a two handed weapon, and to help with threat issues of Retribution.</i></span>

    Adjustment: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Seal and Judgement of Command</span><br>
    Seal of Command now has a small Spell Power modifier, and Judgement of Command now has a small Attack Power modifier.

    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crusading Strikes</span> (Row 6 / 5 Ranks)<br>
    Crusader Strike deals an additional 3/6/9/12/15% damage and Zeal increases your attack and casting speed by an additional 2% per stack.<br>
    Holy Strike infuses you with Holy Might, increasing your Strength by 4/8/12/16/20% for 20 seconds.

    Rework: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Repentance</span><br>
    Now has an effect if the target is immune to crowd control and can be used on all creature types:<br>
    <br>
    Puts the enemy target in a state of meditation, incapacitating them for up to 6 sec. Any damage caused will awaken the target.<br>
    If the target is immune to the effect, it repents for their sins, taking 160 Holy damage every time they attack or cast a harmful spell for 30 sec.<br>
    (The secondary new effect has a 12% Attack Power and 50% Spell Power scaling coefficient, this effect can only trigger once 0.5 seconds and generates no threat.)<br>
    <br>
    Damage Values:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 40/Talent): 80 Holy Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 50): 120 Holy Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 60): 160 Holy Damage</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Repentance is extremely underwhelming against creatures, but an important tool against players. We decided to keep it as a capstone and give it some additional functionality against bosses that fits flavor of Retribution very well.<br>
Note: The damage component will <strong class="text-strong">never</strong> apply to players.</i></span><br>
