    <br>
    Priest as a whole functions very well both as a healer and a damage dealer since the changes done with our first batch of class changes, though it's not without its issues. <br>
    <br>
    First and foremost, Discipline was quite neglected in our first batch of changes, failing to give it tools that allows it to be functional and viable by itself instead of being just a secondary specialization you go into for a few tools.<br>
    <br>
    Secondly, the Holy tree is quite independent of its talent tree to perform well as a healer, perhaps too independent. This allowed Holy to specialize deep into Discipline instead of its own tree, making it feel redundant for the most part. You can read more about these issues and our solutions to them in each specializations’ own sections.<br>

    <ul><li>A new first rank of Lightwell is now acquired at Level 30, with the current ranks being shifted up by one.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    The base healing values for ranks above level 30 and Spell Power scaling for all ranks have been reduced by 15% for the following spells: Lesser Heal, Renew, Heal, Flash Heal, Prayer of Healing, Greater Heal, Desperate Prayer and Lightwell.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change has been done alongside a buff to Spiritual Healing, the introduction of Swift Recovery and updates to Lightwell making it an useful part of a healer’s toolkit. Most players have felt that the majority of the healing talents haven’t felt important enough for most healers which caused them to go deeper into Discipline instead of Holy. The healing output should be about the same as before if not higher when Holy is talented deeper.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    Discipline really lacks any sort of identity outside of a few spells such as Power Word: Shield and Power Infusion. Instead of treading the same path done by other expansions we’ve decided to steer this specialization into another way, reworking Discipline into a holy damage dealing support specialization. <br>
    <br>
    The first part of this is the damage dealing capabilities. For this we’ll be properly tuning Smite and Holy Fire abilities to be reliable tools, add new talents to integrate Holy Fire into the rotation of this revamped specialization and a talent that allows you to properly benefit from the critical strike chance stat, differentiating from Shadow as a damage dealing specialization. <br>
    <br>
    The second part is the support centric abilities that lean into the fantasy of both being disciplined and disciplining others, granting powerful boons at the cost of some health, which also synergizes with your shielding capabilities absorbing this damage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Smite</span> has seen a few buffs:
    <ul><li>Increased base damage values by 10%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Reduced the mana cost of the following ranks:
        <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 14): 60 to 40</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 22): 95 to 60</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 30): 140 to 105</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 6 (Level 38): 185 to 135</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 7 (Level 46): 230 to 165</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 8 (Level 54): 280 to 210</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Rank 9 (Level 60/Book): 300 to 240</li></ul></li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Fire</span> has seen multiple buffs:
    <ul><li>Increased initial cast Spell Power scaling coefficient from 85% to 100%. Note that this was increased from 60% in the first iteration of class changes.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Increased base damage values by 10%.</li></ul>

    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: These changes are meant to compensate the removal of the original Searing Light, scale the mana cost and Spell Power coefficients proportionally to its base cast time. We’ll be keeping a close eye on these abilities due to the numerous buffs and will make adjustments as needed.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Wand Specialization</span>: Now requires 2 points instead of 5 points, also increases your chance to hit with Wands by 5/10% and now gives your wands a chance on hit to grant you an amount of mana equal to your level. This chance is increased with every point.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Piercing Light</span> (1st Row / 3 Points): Reduces the chance for enemies to resist your Holy and Discipline spells by 2/4/6%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mental Agility</span>: Moved from the 4th row to the 1st row and now also reduces the mana cost of your offensive Holy and Discipline spells by 2/4/6/8/10%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spell Warding</span>: Moved from Holy 2nd row to Discipline 2nd row and requires 3 points instead of 5 points.

    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Power Word: Shield</span>: Moved from the 2nd row to the 3rd row.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Searing Light</span> (4th Row / 3 Points): Your damaging Holy and Discipline spell criticals have a 33/66/100% chance to cause your next Smite spell to be instant cast and cost no mana. Lasts 10 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: As a note, instant cast Smites still trigger your global cooldown, in a pure damage output sense this equals to a 0.5 second cast time reduction but the talent giving an instant cast gives Discipline movement flexibility in movement intensive boss fights and player combat.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Purifying Flames</span> (4th Row / 2 Points): Your Holy Fire has a 50/100% chance to increase your Holy damage by 12% for 8 sec.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mental Strength</span>: Now requires 3 points instead of 5 points, increases total intellect instead of mana, and now also increases your casting speed by 1/2/3%
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Enlighten</span> (5th Row Keystone): Bring a party member under your tutelage. Whenever you cast a damaging Discipline or Holy spell, you have a 15% chance to burn them for 4% of their total health as Holy damage and increase your and their spell damage and healing by 10% for 8 sec. If this spell is used on yourself, the spell damage and healing bonus is increased to 15%. You can only have one party member under your tutelage at a time. Lasts 30 min.<br>
    (10% base mana, 1 minute cooldown, 30 yard range, Instant cast.)
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Resurgent Shield</span> (5th Row Capstone): When your Power Word: Shield is broken, 25% of its base mana cost is refunded. Additionally, your damage done by Holy spells and effects will be increased by 6% of the shield's total absorption amount for 8 sec.<br>
    Developer Comment: This talent ties in the shield aspects of the specialization to the new holy damage dealing role that Discipline now has, rewarding them for successfully blocking damage with their shields.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reflective Shields</span>: Removed.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Force of Will</span>: Now also increases the amount of damage absorbed by your Power Word: Shield by 4/8/12/16/20%.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Chastise</span> (7th Row Capstone): Chastise the target, causing X to Y Holy damage and disorienting enemies for up to 3 sec. Any damage caused will remove the effect. If the target is an ally, their attack and casting speed is increased by Z% for 6 sec., increased to 8 sec. if the damage critically strikes the ally.<br>

    Holy performs quite well in all types of content, but the majority of its talent tree tends to feel optional at times, causing Holy healers to specialize more into Discipline instead of their actual trees. We plan to nudge them in the other direction with a buff to the healing increasing talents while applying a baseline nerfs to their healing, meaning they can get the original healing power back by specializing deep into their tree. Additionally some of the talents were adjusted to also work with the revamped Discipline and its support damage abilities.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Healing Focus</span>: Renamed to <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Focus</span> and affects all Holy spells instead of just healing spells.

    We’re quite happy with the current design of Shadow and its support capabilities as a Shadow damage dealer enhancer and mana battery via Vampiric Embrace, so there won’t be any major changes to the specialization aside from some number tuning, nerfs mainly aimed at player combat power and a talent move from Discipline.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Pain Spike</span>’s Spell Power scaling coefficient has been reduced from 42.85% to 25% and its cooldown has been increased from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.

    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While this change hardly matters for combat against creatures, it adds precious few seconds needed to setup for a player kill.</i></span>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vampiric Touch</span>: Reduced the percentage healing increase from 5/10% to 2/5% and reduced the mana granted from 2/4% to 1/2% of any Shadow spell damage the priest deals.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While we love how the supportive aspect of Shadow Priest functions, these changes are done to account for the power increase coming with the increase in Spell Power coefficients and the fact the original talent (Improved Vampiric Embrace) wasn’t adjusted in power for the new mana generation factor. While this nerf looks big, the damage increase is an direct improvement to the healing factor to Vampiric while the mana regeneration is less impacted than initially assumed.</i></span>

    The Night Elf Priest racial <span style="color:#ffbf40">Starshards</span> has been reworked with significant damage buffs, doubled mana cost and has a new 30 second cooldown. We've also fixed an issue with the damage model, restoring the behavior of the channel causing 2 small ticks, 2 medium ticks, and 2 large ticks of damage. The values are as follows:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 10): 100 Mana Cost, 24 / 24 / 36 / 36 / 48 / 48 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 18): 170 Mana Cost, 40 / 40 / 60 / 60 / 80 / 80 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 26): 280 Mana Cost, 70 / 70 / 105 / 105 / 140 / 140 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 34): 380 Mana Cost, 105 / 105 / 158 / 158 / 210 / 210 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 42): 490 Mana Cost, 145 / 145 / 218 / 218 / 290 / 290 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 6 (Level 50): 600 Mana Cost, 190 / 190 / 285 / 285 / 380 / 380 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 7 (Level 58): 700 Mana Cost, 240 / 240 / 360 / 360 / 480 / 480 Arcane Damage</li></ul>
