    There weren't a lot of changes done for Rogues in our first batch of class changes. Similarly to Hunter, Rogue has a specialization that works fine aside from a few pain points, one that’s spot-on flavor but falls short gameplay-wise and one that lacks proper identity and tools especially in a raiding environment. These specializations being Combat, Assassination and Subtlety, in that order, we plan to tackle all these issues in their respective sections.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>BASELINE CHANGES</b></span><br>
    <br>
    Combo Points will no longer vanish upon switching targets, but instead reset when applying combo points on a new target.
    <hr>
    Rogues can now wield <span style="color:#ffbf40">One-Handed Axes</span>.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ghostly Strike</span> is now baseline, learned at level 20.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Heightened Senses</span> is now baseline being learned at level 30, but no longer reduces your chance to get hit by attacks. Its stealth detection increase is equal to the fully talented version of the Subtlety talent.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Sinister Strike</span>’s Energy cost is reduced from 45 to 40.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change was done due to Combat’s Improved Sinister Strike talent going baseline.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Poison: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Corrosive Poison</span>:<br>
    Each strike has a 30% chance of poisoning the enemy for X Physical damage over 12 sec. Stacks up to 5 times on a single target. 105 charges.
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 56): 100 Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 60/Book): 128 Damage</li></ul>
    The Handbook of Deadly Poison V now also teaches the rank 2 of Corrosive Poison. <br>
    Rogues that already know Deadly Poison V will be retroactively taught Corrosive Poison II.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This poison deals slightly less damage than Deadly Poison, but its corrosive properties allows it to bypass conventional Nature and poison immunities, allowing poisons to be a dependable factor in the Rogue’s arsenal no matter the opponent.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Ability: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Deadly Throw</span><br>
    Finishing move that causes thrown weapon damage plus additional damage per combo point:
    <ul><li>1 point : 132-228 damage</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>2 points: 216-312 damage</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>3 points: 300-396 damage</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>4 points: 384-480 damage</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>5 points: 468-564 damage</li></ul>
    (35 Energy cost, 30 yard range, requires Thrown weapon.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This ability was introduced in the first batch of class changes but its addition replaced the original Surprise Attack which was not documented when the changelog was first released, so we’re including this addition for brevity sake, and the fact throwing weapons have seen a rework making this ability much better to use without permanently losing your weapon.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Sprint</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Evasion</span>’s cooldown reduced from 5 minutes to 4 minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This cooldown reduction was done due to Endurance talent from the Combat tree being removed, this way the majority of the talent’s benefit is preserved and granted to all Rogues regardless of their specialization while opening much needed room in the talent tree.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Wound Poison</span> now reduces effectiveness of any healing by 5% per stack, stacking up to 5 times instead of reducing the target’s healing power attribute. All items that were crafted above the first rank are now obsolete and have been converted into the first rank.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Changing how Wound Poison function allows it to counter more healing sources, primarily those that didn’t have any healing power scaling such as healing potions and effects that spend non-mana resources for healing such as Frenzied Regeneration. While Envenom is active this effect is increased by 25% like other poisons, allowing each stack to reduce healing by 6.25% instead of 5%.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crippling Poison</span> (Rank 2)’s slow amount has been reduced from 70% to 60%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change has been done due to the poison being more debilitating that we would like, and that Envenom boost on this effect would be too effective if the slow amount was kept the same, ramping it up to 87.5% slow while active, where now its raised slightly above to its pre-nerf value at a 75% slow.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>ASSASINATION</b></span> <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    This specialization is in a pretty good place flavor-wise but struggled to find its place as a viable damage dealing specialization due to a few reasons:<br>
    <br>
    The first big issue was that poisons were contending for their spot as a temporary weapon enchant with Windfury Totem, with the latter generally being better than poisons. This has now been solved with the totem becoming an aura instead of a weapon enchant. <br>
    <br>
    The second issue is that poisons were not applicable in all content as some creatures have high resistances to the Nature spell school or an outright immunity to Nature or poisons, such as Elementals, Mechanical creatures, Dragons of Nightmare and Solnius. The addition of the Corrosive Poison should solve this issue at its core, you can read more about it in the Baseline Changes section. <br>
    <br>
    The last issue was that its last cornerstone Vigor was especially niche, only seeing use in player combat and nowhere else. We plan to remedy this by introducing a new capstone, moving Vigor a row higher and giving it new additional functionality.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Remorseless Attacks</span>: Duration increased from 20 seconds to 40 seconds.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ruthlessness</span>: Proc chance increased from 20/40/60% to 33/66/100%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Slice and Dice</span>: Renamed to “Improved Blade Tactics” and the text has been changed to: “Increases the duration of your Slice and Dice and Flourish ability by 15/30/45%.”<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: There is no functional change, this is done to clarify the talent description.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Throwing Weapon Specialization</span>: Moved from Combat 5th row to Assassination 4th row. Now gives your <span style="color:#ffbf40">Deadly Throw</span> a 50/100% chance to interrupt the target for 3 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The interrupt was added during the first batch of class changes but wasn’t listed in the changelog.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vile Poisons</span>: Now requires 3 points instead of 5 points.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Poisons</span>: Now requires 3 points instead of 5 points.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Kidney Shot</span>: Removed and replaced with “Taste for Blood”.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Taste For Blood</span> (5th Row / 3 Points): Casting your Rupture ability grants you Taste for Blood, which increases your damage done by 3/6/10% for 6 sec + 2 sec per combo point spent.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This talent grants Assassination a possible extra combo point dump they can use in the situations they have an overflow of combo points and still have both their Slice and Dice and Envenom still active. This effect will be applied no even if the target resists or is immune to the effect of Rupture.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Efficient Poisons</span> (5th Row / 3 Points): Reduces the chance your poisons will be resisted by 4/8/12% and gives your poison applications a 15/30/45% chance to not consume a charge.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vigor</span>: Moved up from the 7th row to the 6th row, now requires 2 points instead of 1 point and now gives a 50/100% chance to gain 5 Energy when applying a poison to your target. This effect can trigger only once every 8 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This revamp to Vigor gives it functionality outside its maximum Energy increase, giving you a reliable source of energy generation to compete with Adrenaline Rush in the long run.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Envenom</span> (7th Row Capstone): Finishing move that increases your poison application chance and effectiveness by 25%.
    <ul><li>1 point : 12 seconds</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>2 points: 16 seconds</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>3 points: 20 seconds</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>4 points: 24 seconds</li> </ul>
    <ul><li>5 points: 28 seconds</li></ul>
    (25 Energy cost)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Effectiveness means that it increases damage for damage dealing poisons, slow amount for Crippling Poison and healing reduction for Wound Poison.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    This specialization is the bread and butter of all Rogues in the original Vanilla and in the current iteration of class changes. We’re overall happy with the state of Combat, but that does not mean it doesn’t have its fair share of issues. Maces being behind other weapon types in performance due to lacking a power increasing weapon specialization talent, Improved Sinister Strike feeling like a mandatory talent and Combat’s rotation lacking variation. We aim to solve these issues alongside some changes to Blade Flurry aimed to grant other specializations the option of a cleave cooldown.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Sinister Strike</span>: Now baseline and therefore replaced by Swift Strikes, see Baseline Changes.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Swift Strikes</span> (1st Row / 2 Points): Increases your melee attack speed by 1/2%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Backstab</span>: Now also gives your Backstab a 15/30/45% chance to award an additional combo point.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Setup</span>: Moved from Subtlety 4th row to Combat 3rd row.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blade Flurry</span>: Moved from the 5th row to the 3rd row, but no longer grants 20% attack speed baseline.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change allows all specializations to have access to a cleave cooldown, which was not possible before due to Blade Flurry’s placement. As a note, Riposte is still in this talent row as an extra capstone and has not been removed.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mace Specialization</span>: Renamed to “<span style="color:#ffbf40">Concussive Blows</span>” and moved up from the 5th row to the 4th row. No longer grants weapon skill to Maces.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The stun component has been made a separate talent due to Maces now being included in the Close Quarters Combat talent, and the random stuns sometimes interfering with some fights such as Battleguard Sartura.<br>
</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Close Quarters Combat</span>: Also includes Maces and now requires 2 points instead of 5 points, increasing your chance to get a critical strike with Daggers, Fist Weapons and Maces by 2/5%.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Surprise Attack</span> (5th Row Capstone): A surprise strike that deals 120% weapon damage. Only usable after the target dodges. Awards 1 combo point.<br>
    (10 Second cooldown, 10 Energy cost.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This attack is triggered on your next attack like Heroic Strike or Raptor Strike. Surprise Attack intends to make Combat feel more active than it was before, rewarding the Rogue for keeping their eyes peeled similarly to Warrior’s Overpower.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Sword Specialization</span>: Renamed to <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hack and Slash</span>, also includes Axes and now now requires 2 points instead of 5 points, giving you a 2/5% chance to get an extra attack on the same target after dealing damage with your Sword or Axe.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blade Rush</span> (5th Row / 2 Points): Reduces the cooldown of your Blade Flurry by 30/60 sec. Your Blade Flurry now increases your attack speed by 5/10% for the duration.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Weapon Expertise</span>: Now gives weapon skill to Maces too.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Aggression</span>: Damage buff increased from 2/4/6% to 3/6/10%, now also includes Riposte and Surprise Attack.<br>

    <br>
    This specialization lacks both identity and falls off in performance in raiding environments due to not being able to use their openers after their stealth and vanish are spent. We’ve considered abilities that would solve this such as Shadow Dance but after lengthy talks the conclusion was that Rogue did not need another flavor of dealing damage, and we’ve gone ahead with quite a different approach: a specialization that focuses on supporting their allies.<br>
    <br>
    Due to this new direction, Subtlety has seen a slew of new talents and changes to existing talents to lean into this direction, doing decent damage themselves but excelling when they’re boosting their allies with their toolkit.<br>
    <br>
    Keep in mind that the majority of the damage talents were left intact, so this change should not harm any of the existing builds used for player combat that utilize this specialization’s talent tree.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master of Deception</span>: Merged into <span style="color:#ffbf40">Camouflage</span>.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Camouflage</span>: Moved from the 2nd row to the 1st row, now also reduces the chance enemies have to detect you in Stealth mode.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Sleight of Hand</span>: Removed.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Ambush</span>: Moved from the 3rd row to the 2nd row, now refunds 5/10/15 Energy if the Ambush does not critically strike.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Serrated Blades</span>: Moved from the 4th row to the 2nd row. Now also increases the damage of your Garrote by 10/20/30% alongside Rupture.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Initiative</span>: Proc chance increased from 25/50/75% to 33/66/100%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ghostly Strike</span>: Now baseline, learned at level 20.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Ghostly Strike</span> (3rd Row / 3 Points): Your Ghostly Strike has a 33/66/100% chance to increase your party members' chance to dodge by 3% for 7 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The dodge cannot be stacked via Preparation recast and multiple Rogues using it in the same party.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent:<span style="color:#ffbf40"> Smoke Bomb </span>(3rd Row Keystone): Creates a cloud of thick smoke in an 8 yard radius around you for 8 sec. All targets inside the smoke have a 20% reduced chance to be hit by attacks and spells for the duration.<br>
    (5 Minute cooldown, 35 Energy cost)
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hemorrhage</span>: Moved from the 5th row to the 3rd row, now only has one rank, grants 2% increased physical damage dealt instead of a flat value, amount of charges increased from 30 to 50, energy cost increased from 35 to 45 and now subject to weapon normalization.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: These changes should make Hemorrhage a more reliable support tool that scales with gear as its now a percentage base increase. The energy cost increase compensated for with the Bloody Mess talent deeper into the tree.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Irritating Agent</span> (4th Row / 3 Points): Reduces all damage dealt of targets hit by your Blind by 2/4/6% for 8 sec. This effect is guaranteed to be applied even if the target is immune to Poisons or Blind is resisted or misses.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The hit chance reduction is applied alongside the disorient effect itself, this is done to minimize its effects in PvP while being a formidable tool to use on powerful creatures and bosses that are immune to the disorient effect. The irritation effect is separate from the disorient effect that is a new Physical debuff that does the effect.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent:<span style="color:#ffbf40"> Blinding Haze </span>(4th Row / 3 Points): Targets hit by your Distract have their chance to hit reduced by 2/4/6% for 5 sec. This effect is guaranteed to be applied.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This works similarly to the Irritating Agent talent, applying a separate Physical debuff with this effect.</i></span>

    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Dust of Disappearance</span> (5th Row Keystone): Throw a pouch of vanishing powder at a friendly player, reducing their threat by 20% and reducing the chance for enemies to detect their presence for 5 sec.<br>
    When the effect is cancelled or expires their next damaging spell or ability will deal 15% more damage.<br>
    (2 Minute cooldown, 30 yard range, 25 Energy cost, costs 1 Flash Powder.)
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bloody Mess </span>(5th Row / 2 Points): Reduces the Energy cost of your Hemorrhage by 5/10 and increases the physical damage dealt bonus of your Hemorrhage by 50/100%

    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Honor Among Thieves </span>(6th Row / 2 Points): Physical critical hits by party members within 20 yards grant you 2/5 Energy. This effect can only trigger once every 2 sec.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tricks of the Trade</span> (6th Row / 5 Points): Your opening and finishing moves have a 4/8/12/16/20% chance per combo point to increase your party's chance to critically strike by 2% for 10 sec. Stacks up to 2 times.<br>

    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Exploit Vulnerability</span> (7th Row Capstone): A marking strike that deals 135% weapon damage and informs your party members of the target's vulnerabilities, increasing their damage dealt to the target by 15% for 6 sec. Awards 2 combo points.<br>
