    Warlocks did not receive any major changes in the first wave of class changes and continue to lack a proper identity between their 3 specializations. While you certainly had an Affliction Warlock with more potent dots, tanky Soul Link Warlock for player combat or the most favorite Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin Warlock, they all were just a Shadow Bolt turret with barely any differences in gameplay. New changes will focus on enabling new spell rotations that better reinforce the fantasy of playing each of the specializations.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>BASELINE CHANGES</b></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Shards</span> will now stack up to 3 instead of 1.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Bags </span>are getting a passive effect similar to Hunter Quivers and Ammo Pouches. The effect is "Your spells have X% chance to not consume a reagent." with a chance percentage ranging from 5% to 25% increasing with the size of the bag.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Infernal Stone</span>’s price is reduced to 10 Silver and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Figurine</span> price to 20 Silver. In addition, both will be able to be placed in Soul Bags and benefit from the new Soul Bag effects.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Drain Soul</span> has seen a rework and now does the following: “Drains the soul of the target, causing X Shadow damage over 6 sec. This damage is dealt slowly at first, and builds up as the drain reaches its full duration. If the target dies while being drained, and yields experience or honor, the caster gains a Soul Shard. Soul Shards are required for other spells.”<br>
    <br>
    Damage Values:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 10): 110</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 24): 280</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 38): 460</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 52): 760</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 60) (New Rank): 950</li></ul>
    (Every tick of damage has a 16.67% Spell Power scaling coefficient.)<br>
    <br>
    Mana Cost:
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 10): 55 -&gt; 90</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 24): 125 -&gt; 235</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 38): 210 -&gt; 405</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 52): 290 -&gt; 540</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 5 (Level 60) (New Rank): 655</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Fire</span> now has two new ranks acquired at earlier levels and slightly shifted the level requirements of the current Soul Fire ranks. With this change the current ranks of Soul Fire have become the lower level versions, so make sure to train your higher ranks.
    <ul><li>Rank 1 (Level 30), 175 Mana Cost, 453 - 571 Fire Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 2 (Level 38): 260 Mana Cost, 544 - 685 Fire Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 3 (Level 48 -&gt; 46): 305 Mana Cost, 623 - 784 Fire Damage</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Rank 4 (Level 56 -&gt; 54): 335 Mana Cost, 703 - 883 Fire Damage</li></ul>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Fire</span> now scales more with Spell Power, gaining 125% of your Spell Power as damage instead of 100%. Due to this spell now having scaling above 100%, its description was updated to specify that it benefits greatly from spell damage.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Fire</span>’s cooldown has been reduced from 1 minute to 30 seconds.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Searing Pain</span> no longer has an increased threat generation component.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This threat removal is compensated by the new Wrathstone.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Curse of Weakness</span> now only has one rank and now reduces the attack speed of your target by 15% instead of a flat damage reduction.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Corruption</span>’s cast time has been reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Baseline Demon Changes</span>: Going forward, demons will not be able to benefit from player buffs and consumables. Allowing buffs on demons meant that you were actively discouraged from using enslave, greater demons or swapping to other common demons because of the downside of losing all the buffs and consumes you (and your raid) put on your demon. This also made greater demons comparably weaker because they did not have all these buffs when summoned mid combat. For warlock specs that actively focus on their demon, this will be compensated by the Demonology tree buffs.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Greater Demons</span> (Infernal, Felguard, Doomguard): These flavourful spells that are meant to allow you to summon powerful demons were severely underpowered and/or clunky to use before and did not fit their intended fantasy. That’s why we decided to rework them and address many pain points of using these spells, while also applying numbers balancing. These greater demons will no longer be a valid target for Enslave Demon and will be immediately under the control of the warlock when summoned, will have set duration for how long you can control them, and after the time is up, they will turn on their master (without ensuing chaos for your whole party). Usefulness and power of these greater demons will be further enhanced in the deep Demonology tree.<br>

    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Demon Gate</span>: renamed from <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demon Portal</span>, 30 min cd, 4 sec cast time, no longer is ritual, but instead drops down a demon gate object that spawns the Felguard after anothe 6 sec, 1 min duration.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Inferno</span>: cooldown reduced from 20 min to 10 min, cast time reduced from 2 sec to 1.5 sec, 30 sec duration.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Ritual of Doom</span>: lowered required players for the ritual from 4 to 2, no longer randomly kills one of the participants, 1 min duration</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Avoidance </span>area of effect damage reduction has been increased from 50% to 80% and it will also effect your greater and enslaved demons.
    <hr>
    New and Reworked <span style="color:#ffbf40">Conjured Stones</span> (Felstone, Firestone, Wrathstone and Spellstone): The original Firestone and Spellstone, while flavourful, were really inconvenient to use since they replaced your off-hand. These new and reworked stones will serve as a new baseline personal buff for Warlocks to use, with Demonology further improving them. All of these stones will only have 1 rank, will give a 30 minute buff on use, are mutually exclusive and not usable in combat.<br>
    <br>
    Stone Effects:
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Firestone</span> (Level 22):, Increases the critical strike chance of your Fire spells by 2% and your main hand and wand attacks have a 40% chance to deal 15 to 20 additional Fire damage on hit. This damage is increased by an amount equal to your level.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Felstone</span> (Level 32): 3% of damage dealt is returned as healing. Additionally, Health restored this way will also heal your active demon.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Wrathstone</span> (Level 42): Increases the threat generated by your Fire spells by 40% and reduces self inflicted Fire damage from Hellfire spell by 30%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Spellstone</span> (Level 52): Reduces threat generated by your spells by 10%.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Healthstones</span> will now all share the same cooldown, no matter their rank or number of talents spent in the Master Conjuror talent. In addition, Soulwell created Healthstones will also properly benefit from the Master Conjuror talent.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demon Skin</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demon Armor</span> are getting merged into one spell. Existing Demon Skin ranks will be renamed to Demon Armor and existing demon armor ranks will be bumped up by two. These skills were always basically the same and this distinction caused unnecessary confusion.<br>

    <br>
    Affliction at its core is decent, but lacks some identity similarly to Demonology lacking variations in its rotation. It also  suffers from issues such as not being able to use Curse of Agony due to requiring to use raid support curses, such as Curse of Elements and Curse of Shadow and overall suffering from the 16 debuff limit that was prevalent in original Vanilla. This issue was fixed at an earlier version of Turtle but we deemed it worthy of mentioning as it was the main blockade that stopped Affliction from properly functioning as a damage over time oriented specialization.<br>
    <br>
    We’re fixing these issues with the revamp to Drain Soul acting as a proper damage dealing ability with Soul Siphon rewarding your damage over time effect upkeep by buffing your Drain Soul damage on the target in addition to the new Dark Harvest capstone being added to your rotation, while the curse issue is solved with the new Malediction capstone allowing you to use Curse of Agony with other support curses.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Corruption:</span> Now reduces the casting time of your Corruption spell by 0.3/0.6/0.9/1.2/1.5 seconds instead of 0.4/0.8/1.2/1.6/2 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change was made to accommodate for the baseline cast time reduction, Corruption still becomes an instant cast spell when this talent is fully talented.</i></span>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Curse of Weakness</span>: Removed.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Drain Soul</span>: Removed.
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Debilitating Curses</span> (2nd Row / 2 Points): Increases the attack speed reduction of your Curse of Weakness by 3/5% and increases the speed reduction of your Curse of Exhaustion by 10/20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Refer to Baseline Changes section for more details on Curse of Weakness’ rework.</i></span>
    <hr>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Resilient Shadows</span> (2nd Row / 3 Points): Reduces the duration of any Interrupt effects used against your Shadow spells by 10/20/30%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Drains</span>: now increases the amount of Mana drained by your Drain Mana by 5/10% instead of dealing damage equal to 15/30% of the mana drained.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Curse of Agony</span>: now is a requirement for getting new talent Malediction and the damage bonus increased from 2/4/6% to 3/6/10%.

    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Amplify Curse</span>: Removed.

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nightfall</span>: Now triggered by Corruption, Dark Harvest and all drain spells instead of Corruption and Drain Life and now has 3 ranks with a 1/3/5% chance to proc.<br>
    <br>
    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rapid Deterioration</span> (5th Row / 2 Points): Increases the casting speed of your Affliction spells by 6%. In addition, casting speed increase effects increase the tick speed of your damage over time and channeled Affliction spells with 50/100% efficiency, reducing their duration.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This talent might seem hard to utilize due to the casting speed increase not being widespread in gear, but we’re also adding alternative tier sets for Affliction that replace the mostly useless critical strike chance with casting speed alongside set bonuses catered towards the specialization.</i></span>

    New Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Malediction</span> (5th Row Keystone): Your Curse of Agony can now be used alongside your other curses, excluding Curse of Doom.

    <br>
    While the core identity of this spec is solid in theory, gameplay-wise there wasn’t much that supported it or differentiated it from other two Warlock specializations. Another huge inconsistency in the original Vanilla design was the placement of Demonic Sacrifice so deep into the tree, because it directly clashes with the focus of the rest of the tree. Compared to the other pet specialization, the Beast Mastery Hunter, we decided to focus on exploitation of your demons and other “forbidden” resources like the Soul Stones, which fits the flavor of Demonology Warlock well. Just like Beast Mastery though, demons will be getting some form of scaling from their master’s power.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Entrapment</span>: While you have no demon under your control, all damage dealt is increased by 1/2/3%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Sacrifice</span>: Demonic Sacrifice was moved higher in the tree and has a new prerequisite talent that both focus on the demon-less Warlock playstyle for other two specializations to pick.<br>
    The effects are:
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Imp:</span> Increases your Fire damage by 6%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Voidwalker:</span> Restores 3% of total Health every 4 sec.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Succubus:</span> Increases your Shadow damage by 6%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Felhunter:</span> Restores 2% of total Mana every 4 sec.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Conjurer</span>: Healthstones created with different ranks of this talent will now be mutually unique, meaning that you will always be able to only have one Healthstone at a time.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Funnel</span>: Funnel spells, even with this talent, were pretty underpowered, that’s why this talent will now scale with the missing Health/Mana of your demon, lowering the Warlock’s dependance on other players healing their demon in clutch situations while also synergizing with the new Power Overwhelming capstone ability.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Aegis</span>: Moved to row 2.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Intellect</span>: Replaced static benefits with Intellect scaling based on 7/14/21/28/35% of your total Intellect and allows 15/30/45/60/75% of your demon's Mana regeneration to continue while casting..
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Stamina</span>: Replaced static benefits with Stamina scaling based on 7/14/21/28/35% of your total Stamina and reduces chance of them being critically struck by 1/2/3/4/5%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Domination</span>: Reduced the cooldown of this ability from 15 min to 5 min and cast time reduction from 5.5 sec to 4 sec. This change gives Demonology more versatility in swapping demons based on their situation. In addition, lowers the cooldown of your Inferno spell by 2.5/5 minutes and the cooldown of your Demon Gate spell by 7.5/15 minutes.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Summoner</span>: Increased mana reduction to 40/60% to again incentivize easier demon switching and now it also lowers the cooldown of your Inferno, Demon Gate and Ritual of Doom spell by 25/50%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Stones </span>(Row 4 / 2 points): Increases the effects of you Wrathstone and Spellstone by 25/50%, increases damage returned as healing of your Felstone by 1/2% and critical strike bonus of your Firestone by 1/2%
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nether Studies</span>: Replaces the original 3 demon specific talents with this new general utility talent while replacing the damage boosting effects with other Demon scaling talents deeper into the tree. The new effect is:<br>
    Increases the effect of your Succubus' Seduction, your Voidwalker's Torment, your Imp's Blood Pact, and your Felhunter's Tainted Blood spells by 15/30/45%.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Unholy Power</span>: Changed from 5 to 3 points, damage increase reduced to 5/10/15% and now affects all demons.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Unleashed Potential</span> (Row 5 / 3 Points): Your direct damage spells have a 60% chance and your funnel spells have a 100% chance to grant your demon Unleashed Potential for 3 sec.<br>
    While Unleashed Potential is active, you demon's Attack Power is increased by 20/40/60% of your bonus spell damage, and its damage done by magical spells and effects is increased by 5/10/15% of your spell damage.
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Power Overwhelming</span> (Row 5 Capstone): Grant your active demon Power Overwhelming that increases its damage dealt by 20% for 10 sec. The demon receives 40% of its Health as damage over the duration.<br>
    (14 second cooldown, 7% base mana cost)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This new capstone ability serves to differentiate your playstyle as Demonology Warlock from the other two specializations while also putting a greater emphasis on managing your demons. It also makes it easier to dispose of your greater demons when their time is running out.</i></span>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Precision</span>: Your demons gain 1/2/3% increased melee and spell hit chance. In addition, they now benefit from 33/66/100% of your own spell hit chance for both melee and spell hit chance.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Similarly to Hunter pets, demons also lack hit chance in the end-game raiding environment, this talent addresses it by transferring your hit to your demons.</i></span>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Demonologist:</span> Reworked bonuses to further support the unique strengths of each demon and incentivize swapping based on the situation you find yourself in. Also new additional effects were added for Infernal and Felguard that give you more power at the cost of downsides further emphasizing their “borrowed power” flavor.<br>
    <br>
    The bonuses are as follows:
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Imp</span>: Reduces spell costs by 3/6/9/12/15% and increases casting speed by 1/2/3/4/5%.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Felhunter</span>: Increases all resistances by 0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1 per level and enemies attacking you have a 10% chance to get affected by Tainted Blood.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Infernal</span>: Increases casting and attack speed by 3/6/9/12/15%, but reduces healing taken by 50%.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#ffbf40">Felguard</span>: Increases all damage done by 4/8/12/16/20%, but increases mana costs by 20%.</li></ul>
    <hr>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Link</span>: Reduced the damage transfer to your demon from 30% to 20% and increased the damage bonus from 3% to 5%. This skill will now be a passive so you don’t have to reactivate it every time you change your demon, will apply to any demon under your control (so both Greater demons and enslaved ones) and will be simply inactive if you don’t have any demon under your control.<br>

    Destruction serves as the primary damage dealing specialization for Warlock in Vanilla, but these specializations are often a mix of talents such as Shadow Mastery/Ruin and Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin, meaning deeper talents in this specializations are ignored after acquiring Ruin. This is primarily the case as Immolation is too mana intensive to constantly cast while Searing Pain has a threat modifier that doubles as threat you generate, forcing you to constantly stop casting in order to not over-aggro the targets you’re damaging.<br>
    <br>
    To solve these issues we have removed the threat modifier from Searing Pain (Check Baseline Changes for more details), tinkered with numbers of Soul Fire baseline and via the new Improved Soul Fire talents to make it a viable ability to use on cooldown and made Conflagration a more desirable capstone to top off this specialization.<br>
    <br>
