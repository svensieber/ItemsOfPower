    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW RAID: TOWER OF KARAZHAN</strong></span><br>
    <br>
    The Tower of Karazhan's haunted upper halls will become accessible to players starting this patch. This raid will feature the new Tier Set 3.5 and challenge 40 players to gameplay even more difficult than Naxxramas, allowing the truly determined to prove their strength against daunting foes. <br>
    <br>
    Conquering the Tower of Karazhan will not only offer great loot and new Tier 3.5 sets, but players can also earn legendary titles:<br>

    <ul><li>Realm First: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Warden of the Ley Lines</span></li></ul>
    <ul><li>Raid Completion for All: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bane of the Nathrezim</span></li></ul>

    <em class="text-italics">Karazhan 40 is like Karazhan 10, but upstairs. Don’t trip over treasure on your way up.</em><br>

    <br>
    While we're happy with the first batch of class changes, they were done under a much more conservative mindset with minor changes, and so vanilla's unbalanced state was still very much felt. Due to this, it fell short on fixing the issues for some of the specializations and failing to make enough impactful changes. It has now been 2 years since those changes and we’re finally taking a deeper dive into balancing and building a solid foundation that’ll serve as the core for all specializations for years to come.<br>
    <br>
    These changes aren’t the final word on class updates. We’ll continue making balance adjustments and potentially soft reworks if a specialization’s changes don’t play out as expected.<br>
    <br>
    Please note that numbers are subject to change along the way throughout 1.17.2. If they do, we will notify you accordingly.<br>

    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Druid</span><br>
    Druids were among the few classes receiving small updates throughout the years following our first round of Class Changes. The ability to equip polearms and the addition of Feral Attack Power on many of the more undesirable weapons found on Azeroth were a great boon to their itemization. While already receiving many alterations before, the Druid class and all its specializations still had some pain points that were in need of some ironing out.<br>

    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Hunter</span><br>
    Our first batch of changes were successful in making Marksmanship Hunters scale better with their gear with the introduction of Trueshot but there are more problems that were not touched on. These are:
    <ul><li>Marksmanship’s power being unattached from its talent tree for the most part.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Survival lacking identity.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Beast Mastery’s viability in raid environments due to lacking scaling.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Pet choices being very limited due to some cutting way ahead of the rest.</li></ul>

    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Mage</span><br>
    Mage is luckily one of those classes that does not struggle with viability, being a class that’s always been a staple for levelling and amongst groups for all types of content. Fire and Frost both have their spots and deal good damage, but their rotations are infamously bland compared to other classes, meanwhile Arcane has a lot of issues with its viability and identity, being a specialization locked to one single target and one area of effect ability. For this reason we’ve added a few things for Fire and Frost to add another layer to their rotations and have done a major rework on Arcane, making it a specialization fitting the nature of Arcane as a spell school that’s wild and uncontrollable.<br>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Paladin</span><br>
    The design of the Paladin class in Vanilla is often considered unfinished, with urban legends (which may or may not be true) suggesting that the lead designers specifically disliked the class. Just before release, both Crusader Strike and Holy Strike were removed. In raids, the main role of Paladins was to bless each member individually every 5 minutes, as Greater Blessings didn't yet exist. Blizzard recognized their mistake and how boring this playstyle was in Patch 1.9, with the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, when Greater Blessings were added. However, the base design of the class was still lacking, and Paladins in any role other than healer were considered very weak compared to other classes, making levelling incredibly dull.<br>
    <br>
    Holy Strike, in its beta form, was restored to Turtle during the server's early days when the client was an unmodified 1.12 version. At the time, this seemed like a good idea, and while it addressed many Paladin issues, it was also quite unbalanced in scenarios with percentage damage increases or in player combat. Crusader Strike, added in the first batch of class changes, was also a restored beta ability, but it too suffered from fundamental issues, resulting in an unrewarding gameplay loop of spamming downranked spells to force chance on hit effects from weapons and armor.<br>
    <br>
    We decided to redesign these abilities from the ground up, offering a new, unified, and improved gameplay experience for all specializations. The new strikes are now a core part of the rotation, regardless of your role. Additionally, the baseline Paladin receives numerous quality-of-life improvements, such as a baseline taunt, increased blessing duration, and the conversion of certain Blessings into Hand spells which do not remove your normal buff Blessings.<br>

    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Priest</span><br>
    Priest as a whole functions very well both as a healer and a damage dealer since the changes done with our first batch of class changes, though it's not without its issues.<br>
    <br>
    First and foremost, Discipline was quite neglected in our first batch of changes, failing to give it tools that allows it to be functional and viable by itself instead of being just a secondary specialization you go into for a few tools.<br>
    <br>
    Secondly, the Holy tree is quite independent of its talent tree to perform well as a healer, perhaps too independent. This allowed Holy to specialize deep into Discipline instead of its own tree, making it feel redundant for the most part. You can read more about these issues and our solutions to them in each specializations’ own sections.<br>

    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Rogue</span><br>
    There weren't a lot of changes done for Rogues in our first batch of class changes. Similarly to Hunter, Rogue has a specialization that works fine aside from a few pain points, one that’s spot-on flavor but falls short gameplay-wise and one that lacks proper identity and tools especially in a raiding environment. These specializations being Combat, Assassination and Subtlety, in that order, we plan to tackle all these issues in their respective sections.<br>

    Shaman changes revolved around fleshing out the class’ melee damage and healing specializations, alongside tackling major issues within its ranged facet; through talent compression and overhaul, we sought to have their trees properly function as the framework on which the class’ diverse iterations could flourish. Rendering their capstones worthy of investment without stifling hybridization between the specializations.<br>

    <span style="color:#FFBF40">Warlock</span><br>
    Warlocks did not receive any major changes in the first wave of class changes and continue to lack a proper identity between their 3 specializations. While you certainly had an Affliction Warlock with more potent dots, tanky Soul Link Warlock for player combat or the most favorite Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin Warlock, they all were just a Shadow Bolt turret with barely any differences in gameplay. New changes will focus on enabling new spell rotations that better reinforce the fantasy of playing each of the specializations.<br>

    Warrior in Vanilla observably has a healthy amount of working builds, with Arms seen in leveling dungeons and battlegrounds, with Fury in leveling and both damage dealing and tanking in raids, and Protection in late dungeons and early raiding. And even better, these builds are fun to play.<br>
    <br>
    We know we can do even better, preserving what already works while also allowing Arms players to continue into raids, see Fury open up options for solo sustain in the world and battlegrounds, and improve Protection's playstyle where we've carved in a niche in leveling and battlegrounds, as now offer a portion of the thrill and performance of the Fury tanking builds.<br>

    <br>
    <a href="https://turtle-wow.org/images/patch_1172/jewelcrafting.png" class="postlink"><img src="https://turtle-wow.org/images/patch_1172/jewelcrafting.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
    <br>
    This fully-fledged profession introduces over 200 new items for you to craft, with recipes obtained from trainers, found in the world, and through exclusive questlines for Jewelcrafters that reward a unique recipe upon completion! Begin your jewelcrafting journey at the trainers located in Stormwind, Ironforge, and Alah'Thalas for the Alliance, or Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Sparkwater Port for the Horde.<br>
    <br>
    What can jewelcrafters expect? Rings, necklaces, staves, trinkets, off-hand frills, helmets, and notably, gemstones—details to follow. Not all items will be available immediately and will unlock as you progress in the profession. Expect new trade goods such as gritted papers, polishing oils, and new jewels like Amber Topaz and Pure Moonstone, to name a few. Jewelcrafting demands collaboration! Some materials will require assistance from other professions, such as Enchanted Gemstone Oils provided by Enchanters.<br>
    <br>
    The profession also introduces two new sub-specializations: Goldsmith and Gemology. You can choose one of these specializations upon reaching a skill level of 225 and character level 40, after completing a related questline, similar to other specializations.<br>
    <br>
    Goldsmiths focus on crafting equipment such as necklaces, rings, bracers, and staves, with most powerful items, such as Epics, exclusive to this specialization.<br>
    <br>
    Gemologists specialize in unique gemstones, empowering necklaces and rings with various effects. Almost all gemstones are exclusive to this specialization.<br>
    <br>
    Concerned about finding enough gems? We’re hosting a Gem Rush event until the release of Patch 1.17.2, which doubles the drop chances for most gemstones, with a few exceptions.<br>
    <br>
    Post-release, all Jewelcrafters will be able to craft Gemstone Clusters, enabling the recycling of materials to acquire more jewels than typically possible through mining.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, rare Gemstone Deposits will now appear in the world. These deposits can replace thorium veins and require a Mining skill of 310. Mining these deposits can yield various gems from different tiers, but most notably, they guarantee an Imperial Topaz, a key material for both Gemology and Goldsmith specializations, akin to Black Lotus and vital for high-level crafts.<br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">NEW TRANSPORT ROUTES</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li>New transport route: flight from Undercity to Steepcliff Port, and back.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>New transport route: flight from Ironforge to Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility, and back.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Replaced the teleportation to Icepoint Rock with an actual boat route both ways.</li></ul>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><strong class="text-strong">USER INTERFACE &amp; REDUCED ADD-ON DEPENDENCY</strong></span><br>

    <ul><li>Inspected talents are now updated when you change a target.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Adjusted the size of the talent tree tabs at the top of the frame to fit within the inspect frame.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The Profession UI is now larger, showing craftable items on the left, recipe details on the right and a search bar to look for just the right recipe.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Added a new option that will position the loot window at the cursor when enabled. This option can be found in Interface Options.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Right-clicking an item in your bags while the auction house UI is open and the 'Auctions' tab is active will now put that item into the 'Auction Item' slot.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Auction House duration values have been updated on the interface to reflect the actual values. (8h, 24h and 72h)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Applied minor visual changes to the Transmogrification interface.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Hovering over 'Supercharged Chronoboon Displacer' in your inventory will now display a list of stored world effects in the tooltip along with their duration without the use of an Addon.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>The Looking for Turtles (LFT) bundled addon has been rewritten from the ground up. The client part of the addon handles the interface and user input, while the server handles the whole grouping logic. This move from a client-only approach provides a much more reliable way of finding dungeon groups.</li> </ul>

    As part of these changes, the 'Browse' tab has been removed and will be replaced with a better system in the upcoming patch.<br>

    <ul><li>The 2FA randomized numpad is getting more comfortable in the upcoming patch. Yes, we felt the pain too!</li></ul>
