    <hr>

    Druids that obtained their <span style="color:#ffbf40">Swift Travel Form</span> will be able to obtain the ability to transport party members on their back with the <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tome of the Wild Ride</span>. Only those seen as worthy by the Green Dragonflight will gain this power.<br>

    <hr>

    New Spell: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reshift</span><br>
    Learned at Level 60.<br>
    Cancels and reapplies the current shapeshift form.<br>
    (35% Base Mana Cost, Requires a non-Swift Travel Form shapeshift form to be active.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Feral Combat Cats have access to multiple tools to regain Energy during combat. One of them is the use of the Furor talent, setting their Energy to a specific amount upon entering Cat Form. Utilizing this can be quite cumbersome for players with higher ping, resulting in a clunky feeling while executing the high octane play Feral Combat Cat is known for.<br>
<br>
With Reshift, we’re reducing the needed amount of actions for this from two (cancel form and reapplying it) to one (pressing Reshift), allowing players to enjoy this tool in a more fluent way.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    You can now use <span style="color:#ffbf40">Jujus, Gift of Arthas, Lucidity Potion and Bandages</span> in Cat and (Dire) Bear Forms.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tiger's Fury:</span> Now also generates 10 Energy every 3 seconds. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To allow Druids additional Energy gain in combat, we’ve added an Energy regeneration effect to all ranks of Tiger’s Fury, helping players against Bleed immune targets and those not wishing to utilize the Furor talent.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ferocious Bite:</span> Each extra point of energy now increases damage by 0.5% instead of increasing it by a flat amount.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The key part of Ferocious Bite is the ability to convert Energy beyond its 35 Energy cost into damage at an increasing rate depending on the rank. This, however, more often than not resulted in dissatisfaction, since the converted Energy does not justify the increased damage gained by it. <br>
<br>
We’ve contemplated limiting or even downright removing the Energy conversion, but decided against it to prevent it becoming too similar to Rogue’s Eviscerate. Instead, we changed the conversion rate from a flat amount per point to a percentage based one, allowing the ability to scale better and making use of the Energy conversion more satisfying.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rip:</span> Duration now scales with the amount of combo points spent, lasting the following durations per combo point spent instead of always lasting 12 seconds. Damage dealt every second and Attack Power scaling is unchanged, meaning the ability deals up to 50% more damage per cast.<br>
    1 Combo Point: 12 -&gt; 10 Seconds<br>
    2 Combo Points: 12 -&gt; 12 Seconds (Unchanged)<br>
    3 Combo Points: 12 -&gt; 14 Seconds<br>
    4 Combo Points: 12 -&gt; 16 Seconds<br>
    5 Combo Points: 12 -&gt; 18 Seconds<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’re continuing to place our focus on Druid’s Bleed abilities to augment Feral Combat Cat’s playstyle. With the many parts needing attention during combat, keeping up Rip optimally can often result in constricted gameplay, as there is simply not enough time to make full use of its presence. We’ve increased Rip’s duration, and subsequently its damage to give it both a small boost and to let gameplay flow more easily.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rejuvenation</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Regrowth:</span> Heal over time effects now heal every 2 seconds instead of 3 seconds, total healing and healing power scaling remains roughly the same. Also reduced <span style="color:#ffbf40">Regrowth</span>'s duration from 21 seconds to 20 seconds to match the new healing interval.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Restoration Druids have their focus put on their Healing over Time spells, namely Rejuvenation and Regrowth. While powerful tools, one of their downsides is that the time for their healing to trigger can often be simply too long. To push these two spells in scenarios with many different healer healing at once, we’ve reduced the time needed for them to heal, making them heal less but more frequently.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Efflorescence:</span> Fixed an issue that caused Efflorescence to heal less than intended.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Balance</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nature's Reach:</span> Now also increases the range of Abolish Poison and Remove Curse.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Restoration Druids going for Nature’s Grace and Moonglow in the Balance Tree often sacrifice talent points in talents that benefit themselves very little. To help them out, we’re adding the cleansing abilities of Druid to Nature’s Reach, creating a unique advantage compared to other healers.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Balance of All Things:</span> Starfire cast time reduction reduced from 0.8 seconds to 0.5 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: To level the new power gained by the changes to Eclipse we reduced the bonus gained by Astral Boon. This in part also helps Druid’s clipping into the global cooldown of Starfire and raise the benefit of the Haste stat for them.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Gale Winds:</span> Now also reduces Hurricane's mana cost by 10/20% and its attack speed reduction duration is reduced from 10 seconds to 2 seconds. This only affects it when a target leaves the Hurricane's area of effect as it's constantly re-applied otherwise.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Gale Wind gets a sizable mana cost reduction to raise its appeal. Additionally, we’re adjusting the debuff placed on targets to avoid it being applied longer than intended.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Eclipse:</span> Reworked to the following: "Aligns natural and astral energies. Damage from Wrath has a 30% chance to grant Arcane Eclipse, increasing Arcane damage dealt. Damage from Starfire has a 50% chance to grant Natural Eclipse, increasing Nature damage dealt.<br>
    The damage bonus granted is 10% plus an additional 60% of your critical spell strike chance. Each effect lasts 15 sec and has its own 30 sec cooldown. Only one Eclipse can be active at a time."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Eclipse has become a favourite among Balance Druids and we are glad it got the warm welcome we had hoped for. Still, due to its dependency on the critical strike chance stat, it saw little value during the leveling phase and during the early gearing progression. To both preserve the scaling nature of Eclipse and give it more play in the two aforementioned scenarios - as well as providing a bit more consistency - we increased the proc chance to a flat percentage and altered the damage bonus a bit to a flat bonus plus a scaling component.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Open Wounds:</span> Moved from Row 2 to Row 5, no longer increases Ferocious Bite's damage per active Bleed effect and now increases Rip's damage by 5/10/15%. <br>
    New Description: "Increase the damage of Rip by 5/10/15%. Additionally, increase the damage of Claw by 10/20/30% for each of your active Bleed effects on the target."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: With the added power to baseline Ferocious Bite, we’re shifting the focus of Open Wounds completely on Bleeds, having it increase the damage of Rip instead, moving basic power of other abilities away from Bleed effect dependency.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Shred:</span> Now always increases the damage done by Shred by 5/10% without having to enter Cat Form to activate it.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The condition to enter Cat Form first is being removed to grant the damage bonus to Feral Combat Cat players who are not utilizing the Furor talent in combat, as well as granting some more power against Bleed immune targets.<br>
</i></span>
    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Primal Fury:</span> Moved from Row 4 to Row 3.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Savage Fury:</span> Removed, effect integrated into Predatory Strikes.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Predatory Strikes:</span> Now also increases the damage caused by your Claw, Rake, Maul, Savage Bite and Swipe abilities by 7/14/20% in addition to increasing your total Attack Power.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We are merging these two talents together to grant players more points to spend due to the addition of the talent Carnage.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ancient Brutality:</span> Moved from Row 6 to Row 5, reduced Energy gain from Bleed ticks from 5/10 to 3/5.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The Ancient Brutality talent proved to be a great way for Feral Combat Cats to regain Energy in combat utilizing their Bleed abilities - the amount turned out to be too much, however. This was prominently shown in PvP scenarios, where placing Bleeds on multiple targets simulated the power of the Berserk ability. This change also places some power out of Bleed effects in PvE, making combat against Bleed immune targets less frustrating.<br>
<br>
To compensate for this change, Tiger’s Fury was granted an Energy gain component.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Feral Adrenaline:</span> Removed.<br>

    <hr>

    New Talent (Row 6 / 2 Points): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Carnage</span><br>
    "Maul, Swipe and Savage Bite return 5/10% of their damage as healing to you. Ferocious Bite has a 10/20% chance per combo point spent to refresh your active Rake and Rip effects and add an additional combo point."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’re reintroducing the healing portion removed from Ancient Brutality with this new talent. Feral Combat Cat's will have the ability to refresh Rake and Rip on the target, giving them an easier way to maintain their Bleed effects as well as keeping the flow of combo point generation and spending more rapidly. This change should loosen up the tight time window in between ability uses.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Restoration</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Aessina's Bloom:</span> Now requires Improved Healing Touch as a pre-requisite talent instead of Swiftmend, effect reworked: "Healing a target affected by Regrowth or Rejuvenation with your Healing Touch spells reduces the casting time of your next Healing Touch spell by 0.15/0.3 sec and refunds 5/10% of its mana cost within 20 seconds."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Aessina’s Bloom was designed to add synergy between multiple Restoration Druids. While we think it had a good direction, its start was a bit bumpy. Therefore we’re changing how Aessina’s Bloom works: Instead of additional healing in the style of Swiftmend, Aessina’s Bloom will now reduce the casting time of Healing Touch when healing a target affected by either Rejuvenation or Regrowth. Coupled with a mana refund effect, Druids should be able to make use of Healing Touch more effectively and longer.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Genesis:</span> Moved from Row 4 to Row 3.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nature's Swiftness:</span> Swapped talent locations with Aessina's Bloom and now requires Genesis as a pre-requisite talent instead of Swiftmend.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’re switching these two talents to have Aessina’s Bloom match its position and talent dependency more thematically.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Regrowth:</span> Now requires Gift of Nature as a pre-requisite talent instead of Genesis.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Gift of Nature:</span> Moved from Row 3 to Row 4 and now increases total healing instead of base healing, meaning it now benefits from healing power and other effects that increase your healing done.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This talent had sadly very little popularity due to the little power gain it provided. Since Restoration druids deserve a boost in throughput, this talent will no longer be affecting only the base values of the healing spells.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tree of Life Form:</span> Now increases armor contribution from items by 180%.<br>
