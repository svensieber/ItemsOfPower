    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Physical Damage Reduction</span> from <span style="color:#ffbf40">Armor</span> is no longer capped at 75%. The extra reduction gained from Armor beyond this point will be diminished. The updated formula will be shared later.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Currently some classes and specializations are running into the issue of getting hard-capped by Armor. This severly limits their possible build paths. We intend to remedy this by reducing the extra damage reduction beyond 75% gained from extra Armor but removing the hard cap.<br>
<br>
Note that we are very aware of the effects this can have on gameplay if the extension of the formula beyond 75% does not have enough diminishing returns, this is taken into account.<br>
