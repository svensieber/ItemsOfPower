    <hr>

    Hunters now learn <span style="color:#ffbf40">Pet Command: Take Position</span> when they learn Tame Pet. This command allows you to select a location to send your pet to, cancelled by clicking Follow again. Take Position obeys line of sight rules, meaning pets cannot be sent to locations you can’t see.<br>
    This spell allows Hunters to more accurately position their pets, putting them out of danger’s way and adjusting their location behind bosses to avoid pets getting parried.<br>

    <hr>

    Added new pet family abilities for <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tallstriders</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spiders</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hyenas</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bears</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crocolisks</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crabs</span>, and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Raptors</span>! These new abilities can be found by taming specific creatures in the wild.<br>
    With these additions we can happily say all pet families now have a special ability. We'd recommend going out there and discovering them yourself, but you can find a list below if you want to learn about them now:<br>
    <br>

    <div><div class="quotetitle"><input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0;padding:0;color:#000" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';        this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }"></div><div class="quotecontent"><div style="display:none">
        <br>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tallstriders: Strider Presence</span> — Allows party members to generate a portion of their health while in combat and mana while casting. This effect lasts indefinitely.
        <hr>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spiders: Web</span> — Roots a target for a few seconds, then heavily slows them afterwards.
        <hr>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hyenas: Packleader</span> — Calls a Pack Ally to aid you for a few seconds. The Pack Ally takes reduced damage from area of effect attacks, obeys the commands given to your primary pet, and does not generate any threat.
        <hr>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bears: Roar of Fortitude</span> — Lets out a fortifying roar, reducing damage taken by your party members and increasing their damage dealt for a few seconds.
        <hr>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crocolisks: Death Roll</span> — Initiates a death roll, heavily slowing the target and rapidly dealing damage. Damage is increased against enemies with low health.
        <hr>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crabs: Bubble Barrier</span> — Envelops your pet in a bubble that absorbs damage. When the bubble breaks or expires, it deals Frost damage to all nearby enemies.
        <hr>
        <span style="color:#ffbf40">Raptors: Savage Rend</span> — Slashes your enemy, dealing damage and causing a bleed every second for a short duration. The bleed duration is increased if the slash is a critical strike.</div></div></div>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hunter Aspects</span> now appear on the stance bar, similiar to Druid shapeshifting forms and Paladin auras.<br>
    <br>
    Lower ranks of <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hunter Aspects</span> are now replaced by the highest rank.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Moving aspects to the stance bar should open up precious room in your action bars, we've also hidden the earlier ranks of the Hunter aspects to prevent issues with multiple earlier ranks appearing in the stance bar and due to earlier ranks not having a reason to be used in majority of the cases.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    You can no longer swap your active pet while in combat or while feigning death.<br>
    <br>
    Swapping your active pet with <span style="color:#ffbf40">Caretaker Brambleclaw</span> now prevents you from swapping again for 1 minute. This does not apply when placing an active pet into the stables without picking a new pet.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The introduction of Caretaker Brambleclaw as a portable stable master led to some strategies where Hunters would swap between multiple long cooldown pet family abilities, leading to an unhealthy gameplay pattern, for this reason we're limiting swapping active pets in combat and adding a cooldown to prevent swapping pets constantly to utilize multiple pet ability cooldowns at the same time.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mongoose Bite:</span> Now strikes with both of your weapons if you are dual wielding.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The main factors that cause a big gap between Two-Handed and Dual Wield playstyles for Survival Hunter has been the fact their abilities only strike with the main-hand weapon only and the lack of hit, the second part can always be remedied by using hit gear but the first one couldn't be, so we're changing that now. With this change Mongoose Bite should feel roughly the same for both playstyles.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rapid Fire:</span> Now increases all attack speed by default, meaning it increases both melee and ranged attack speed.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We've made this part of the Rapid Strikes' effect baseline due to the talent being replaced by Lacerate.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Growl:</span> Reduced Focus cost from 15 to 10.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Growl tends to be a big Focus sink while leveling as its mandatory to keep a creature aggro-ed onto your pet, leaving precious little of it for any other abilities your pet might want to use, so we're slightly reducing its cost to allow your pets' other abilities to shine.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Screech (Carrion Bird/Owl):</span> Now scales with your pet's Attack Power, dealing 1 extra damage for every 25 Attack Power and has a 5 second cooldown.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Furious Howl (Wolf):</span> Now scales with your pet's Attack Power, granting additional Physical damage on next melee hit, adding 1 extra Physical damage for every 25 Attack Power.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Charge (Boar):</span> Now scales with your pet's Attack Power, granting additional Attack Power to the boar's next attack equal to 35% of its Attack Power.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Since we've added Attack Power scaling to other pet family abilities these abilities had fallen behind due to lacking this interaction and therefore not benefiting from the pet's own Attack Power and the Attack Power gained from the Spirit Bond talent. <br>
<br>
Specifically for Screech, we've given it a minor cooldown due to its multi-target threat generation vastly outperforming most other options and taken this cooldown in account for its damage scaling. With this cooldown the Attack Power reduction does not have a full uptime but this can be remedied by getting the Bestial Discipline talent with its new effect, detailed below.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Beast Mastery</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Endurance Training:</span> Health increase reduced from 3/6/9/12/15% to 1/2/3/4/5%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Thick Hide:</span> Armor increase reduced from 10/20/30% to 4/7/10%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: These percentage scaling effects have been shown to be quite strong as they also amplify the stats they inherit from the pet's owner, for this reason we're pulling this percentage scaling down to compensate for this.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bestial Swiftness:</span> Removed.<br>
    <br>
    New Keystone (Row 3 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Coordinated Assault</span><br>
    "Hitting an enemy with Arcane Shot, Steady Shot or Raptor Strike causes your pet's next attack within 6 sec to also perform an attack that deals Physical damage equal to 30% of its Attack Power. This can only occur once every 3 sec."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Coordinated Assault now serves as the first keystone talent of Beast Mastery, replacing Bestial Swiftness as a more damage oriented effect, now ordering your pet to perform an attack alongside you on a short cooldown, with the benefit of being a decent keystone for all specializations but especially shining when your pet starts to scale with Spirit Bond in later levels.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    New/Returning Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Pathfinding</span> (Row 3 / 2 Pointer): Increases the speed bonus of your Aspect of the Cheetah and Aspect of the Pack by 3/6% and increases your pet's movement speed by 15/30%. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're re-introducing this talent due to the removal of Bestial Swiftness in the favor of a new keystone talent and adding the pet movement speed effect to it, now without the outdoors requirement.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bestial Discipline:</span> Moved up a row and now reduces the cooldown of your pet's special ability by 10/20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Thanks to all pet families now having their own special abilities, we can utilize that fact by adding synergy to the Beast Mastery talent tree without majority of pet families being left out from it aside from a few specific examples such as Cats and Tallstriders due to their abilities not being directly combat related and not having a cooldown to reduce.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bestial Precision:</span> Increased spell hit chance from 6/12% to 9/18%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Pets that have abilities that deal spell damage were disadvantaged as melee abilities had capped hit chance while spells didn't, this change should fix this inconsistency.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Intimidation:</span> No longer a dependency.<br>

    <hr>

    New Keystone (Row 5 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Kill Command</span><br>
    "Give the command to kill, removing any crowd control effect from your pet and causing your pet's next 2 abilities within 10 sec to be guaranteed to critically strike with 50% increased critical strike damage if that ability is capable of striking critically."<br>
    (Kill Command's global cooldown is 1 second instead of 1.5 seconds.)<br>
    (5% base mana, 45 yard range to your pet, 12 second cooldown.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're adding a new keystone in addition to Intimidation to Beast Mastery that'll diferentiate its playstyle from Marksmanship and interact more closely with their pets, Kill Command synergizes greatly with your pet's unique abilities and Coordinated Strike as its considered an ability for this spell. <br>
This spell also has the effect of removing any active crowd control effects from your pet due to Bestial Wrath's replacement removing the possibility of making your pet immune to these effects.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bestial Wrath:</span> Removed.<br>
    <br>
    New Capstone (Row 7 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Baited Shot</span><br>
    "An instant shot that deals 125% weapon damage and attaches a bait to the target. The target takes 15% more damage from your pet and your pet's attacks to the target generate 5 Focus for 8 sec. Can only be used after your pet critically strikes a target and Focus generation can trigger only once every 2 sec."<br>
    (7% Base Mana Cost, 8 Second Cooldown, 35 Yard Range, Instant Cast)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This new capstone replaces Bestial Wrath as a more active part of gameplay, activating whenever your pet critically strikes which can be guaranteed with Kill Command. The focus generation has a short cooldown to prevent creating a big gap between fast and slow attacking pets and is balanced accordingly.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Marksmanship</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    We believe Marksmanship is in a good spot. We are considering taking another look at the design of Trueshot Aura and possibly at Volley in a future update but for now we don't believe the specialization needs any change.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Survival</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rapid Strikes:</span> Removed, cooldown reduction moved to Vicious Strikes.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Feign Death:</span> Chance to be resisted reduction increased from 2/4% to 4/8%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Survival quite struggles with threat issues currently, so we're improving the resistance reduction to make Feign Death much more reliable as a threat drop. We'll be monitoring the state of threat after this change goes live and do further changes as needed.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    New Keystone (Row 5 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lacerate</span><br>
    Deepen your target's open wound, dealing damage equal to 35% of your melee Attack Power and bleeding them for 20% of the damage over 8 sec. Can only be used after critically striking your target. Using this ability from the sides of your target increases its damage by 10% and causes the bleed to deal its total damage 100% faster.<br>
    (8% Base Mana Cost, 10 Second Cooldown, Melee Range)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're adding a new keystone talent to replace Rapid Strikes as it felt quite passive compared to similiar same row talents. Lacerate aims to be a more reactive ability compared to Survival's existing abilities that uniquely rewards usage from the sides of the target, previously unseen in Vanilla. Its also a homage to the early version of the Survival talent tree where Lacerate was the original capstone.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Resourcefulness</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Savage Strikes</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Killer Instinct</span>: Now also affect Lacerate.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vicious Strikes:</span> Now reduces the cooldown of Raptor Strike and Mongoose Bite by 0.5/1 second but the damage increase is reduced from 10/20% weapon damage and 10/20 flat damage to 5/10% weapon damage and 5/10 flat damage.<br>
