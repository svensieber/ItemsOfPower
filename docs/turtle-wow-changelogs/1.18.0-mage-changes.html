    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Baseline Changes</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flamestrike:</span> Cast time reduced from 3 seconds to 2.5 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Arcane</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Rupture:</span> Reduced the damage and mana cost increase given to Arcane Missiles from 25% to 20%. This also affects Arcane Tier 1 8 Set Bonus.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Focus:</span> Swapped talent position with Magic Absorption.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While this change doesn't affect Arcane Mages for the most part, it allows both Fire and Frost Mages to go down to the 2nd row of the Arcane tree without being forced to get a talent that would largely be useless for their playstyles.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>Fire</b></span></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flame Throwing:</span> Now also increases the radius of your Blast Wave by 10/20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This was done mainly for parity reasons with other similiar range increasing talents that also increase the radius of Area of Effect spells.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Ignite:</span> Duration reduced from 6 seconds to 4 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're reverting the original duration for Ignite due to the longer duration not fully hitting its mark, having the effect of having more Fire Mages end up as a throughput loss compared to only having one and the solo Fire Mage being forced to spam Scorch to reliably keep up the Ignite. <br>
<br>
Initially this was modified to a 6 second duration to free up Mages to play different specs while being able to keep Ignite up with fewer Fire Mages. Now with the other specs being attractive enough to play on their own we once again want to promote more Ignite cooperation.<br>
<br>
We'll keep monitoring Ignite even after this change as it's a delicate talent with a unique mechanic.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hot Streak:</span> Now has 2 ranks instead of 3 ranks, meaning Fireball and Fire Blast spell criticals have a 50/100% chance instead of 33/66/100%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Fire is quite short on talent points and the addition of Hot Streak made this shortage much worse, to the point some straight up skip this talent, we're hoping a smaller point requirement will make this talent more accessible.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master of Elements:</span> Mana refund increased from 10/20/30% to 15/30/45% of their base mana cost.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: In addition to making Arcane Concentration more available with the talent position change, we're putting more power into Fire's own mana sustain talent to feed into the steep mana costs of the specialization.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blast Wave:</span> Cooldown reduced from 45 seconds to 30 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Fire has been quite struggling using its own Area of Effect spells over other specializations' spells due to them lacking the same throughput, so we're making Flamestrike slightly faster to cast (as mentioned above) and reducing Blast Wave's cooldown by a good margin to make them more desirable.</i></span><br>
