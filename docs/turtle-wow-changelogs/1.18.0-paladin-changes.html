    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hand of Freedom:</span> Cooldown increased from 20 seconds to 24 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Divine Shield:</span> Damage reduction increased from 50% to 60%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Paladins have emerged as one of the top-performing classes in PvP, especially in arena formats. Their combination of burst damage, defensive cooldowns, and utility makes them incredibly hard to counter when played well. While we don’t want to overcorrect and impact their PvE viability, a few adjustments are being made to reduce some of their more oppressive tools in PvP scenarios.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Holy</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Daybreak:</span> Reworked to the following: "Critically healing an ally leaves Daybreak on them for 30 seconds. The next time an ally with Daybreak takes damage, they are healed for 348 to 389 and Daybreak is consumed."<br>
    This healing has a 43% Spellpower scaling coefficient and cannot critically heal and can be triggered by Holy Strike's healing.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Daybreak, as a capstone talent, felt lacking in both thematic impact and mechanical identity. It didn’t offer a strong payoff compared to the investment required to reach it. With this rework, our goal is to give Holy Paladins a unique form of conditional healing—one that fits thematically without introducing traditional heal-over-time mechanics that conflict with the Paladin identity. It’s meant to offer reactive sustain and strategic value in group content.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Shock:</span> Restored damage dealing functionality with the following damage values:<br>
    Rank 1 (Level 30): 97 to 104 Holy Damage<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 40): 142 to 154 Holy Damage<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 48): 198 to 214 Holy Damage<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 58): 256 to 271 Holy Damage<br>
    Damage has 43% Spellpower scaling coefficient.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: When we introduced Class Changes 2, we disabled offensive use of Holy Shock to avoid interactions with Blessed Strike that could result in cooldown abuse. In hindsight, this decision stripped away one of the spec’s most iconic and fun playstyles—the “Shockadin.” We’re reversing that decision with a slightly weakened version of the spell’s damage output to avoid healer burst. We will be watching closely to ensure this reintroduction doesn’t disrupt balance in PvE or PvP.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Retribution</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Crusader Strike:</span> Spellpower scaling coefficient reduced from 33% to 20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Seal of Righteousness:</span> Two-Handed weapon spellpower coefficient reduced from 12.8% x Weapon Speed to 12.5% x Weapon Speed.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: These targeted reductions bring spellpower-based Retribution builds closer in line with their physical damage counterparts, especially Seal of Command. We want to maintain hybrid flexibility, but not at the cost of overcentralizing builds around spell scaling.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vindication:</span> Description updated to specify that it's only applied to enemies Level 62 or lower.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vengeance:</span> Description updated to mention that its threat reduction does not apply when Righteous Fury is active.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer's Note: These tooltip updates reflect mechanics that weren’t clearly communicated to players. No mechanical changes—just improved clarity.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Protection</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    Protection Paladins are thriving in Tower of Karazhan, with strong threat generation, consistent mitigation, and reliable utility. Their performance is aligned with our expectations, and as such, no balance changes are being made this cycle.<br>
    <br>
    We are, however, evaluating ways to improve Crusader Strike's feel in the rotation for Protection and hope to shift some of the current reliance away from Holy Strike in future updates.<br>
