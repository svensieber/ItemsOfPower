    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Smite:</span> Rank 9 mana cost reduced from 240 to 225.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The new rank introduced for Smite ended up costing too much mana for the extra damage it provided, so we're reducing the cost to increase the damage to mana ratio.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mind Blast:</span> Threat modifier reduced from 200% to 170%.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Shadow</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vampiric Embrace:</span> Removed cast time.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We've heard your feedback about the cast time feeling too rigid to use and are returning the original instant-cast functionality.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Shadow Weaving:</span> Debuff renamed from "Shadow Vulnerability" to "Shadow Weaving" to avoid confusion with the Warlock talent with the same name.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Shadow Mend:</span> Has been reworked:<br>
    - Cast time reduced from 3 to 1.5 seconds.<br>
    - Mana cost reduced from 635 to 270.<br>
    - Healing increased from 518-616 to 759-896.<br>
    - Spellpower coefficient changed from 85.71% to 50%.<br>
    - Shadow spellpower now increases its healing alongside healing power, increasing it for 20% of your shadow spellpower.<br>
    - Can no longer target the caster.<br>
    - Now damages you for 50% of the effective healing done, meaning you're not damaged for overhealing. This damage cannot kill you.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Shadow Mend has been a largely unused spell due to its steep cost, long cooldown and weak healing, for this reason we're reworking it into something more unique, now scaling with your shadow spellpower in addition to healing power, having a much faster cast, lower mana cost and healing but now damaging you for half the healing it does.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Holy</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Holy Nova:</span> Has seen various changes:<br>
    - Reduce mana costs by roughly 20% for all ranks:<br>
    Rank 1 (Level 20): 185 → 150<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 28): 290 → 235<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 36): 400 → 360<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 44): 520 → 415<br>
    Rank 5 (Level 52): 635 → 510<br>
    Rank 6 (Level 60): 750 → 600<br>
    - Base damage reduced by 5% for all ranks.<br>
    - Spellpower scaling reduced from 16% to 15% for all ranks.<br>
    - Now generates 25% reduced threat.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Holy Nova, while a powerful area of effect damage and heal combined is a very mana hungry spell, often causing the user to run out of mana after a few uses, for this reason we've reduced the mana cost by a good margin, very slightly reduced the damage and spellpower scaling to compensate. <br>
In addition to this, we've added some threat reduction to compensate for the fact of healing and damaging at the same time generating much more threat than spells that do only one of them.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Empower Champion:</span> Replaced 30 Attack Power and 20 Spellpower with 5% increased damage dealt.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Proclaim Champion:</span> Replaced 230 Armor with 5% damage reduction and replaced 10 All Resistances with All Resistances equal to 50% of your level.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The champion capstone has been underused due to the effects not properly scaling with level and gear, for this reason we're swapping the flat attack power, spellpower, armor and resistance increases with percentage effects that benefit from the aforementioned factors.</i></span><br>
