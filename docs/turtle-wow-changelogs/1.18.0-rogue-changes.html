    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Baseline Changes</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    New Passive: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Quickfooted</span><br>
    Learned at Level 30.<br>
    "Your movement speed is increased by 7%. This stacks with other movement speed increasing effects."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Rogues are famously known for their nimbleness but this wasn't seen outside of Sprint, making them struggle keeping up with other classes at times. <br>
<br>
We first considered adding effects that increase movement speed to each specialization's talent tree but decided on doing a baseline passive as this is class and not build specific.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blade Flurry:</span> Now baseline at level 30, no longer has a duration, cooldown reduced from 2 minutes to 4 seconds, and instead works as a toggled effect. Blade Flurry reduces energy generation by 30% and reduces damage dealt by 20% while active.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Blade Flurry is moving from a long cooldown ability to a toggled effect, reducing damage and energy regeneration but granting a cleave effect. <br>
<br>
While juggling the cooldown of your only cleave effect is a skill of its own, in practice it didn't give Rogues this agency as it was often used right off cooldown whenever multiple enemies are being fought. <br>
<br>
This change will move the decision making away from spending a high cooldown or not and instead allows Rogues more agency in keeping it active or not, losing possible Energy if not properly timed.<br>
</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Expose Armor:</span> First three ranks can now be learned at an earlier level: <br>
    Rank 1: 14 -&gt; 10 <br>
    Rank 2: 26 -&gt; 22 <br>
    Rank 3: 36 -&gt; 34 <br>
    Rank 4: 46 -&gt; 46 (Unchanged)<br>
    Rank 5: 56 -&gt; 56 (Unchanged)<br>

    <hr>

    New Poison: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Dissolvent Poison</span><br>
    Coats a weapon with poison that lasts for 30 minutes. Each strike has a 20% chance of poisoning the enemy which instantly inflicts Physical damage. This damage ignores armor.<br>
    Rank 1 (Level 52): 88 to 113 Physical Damage, 100 Charges<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 60): 106 to 142 Physical Damage, 115 Charges<br>
    Both Ranks of Dissolvent Poison gain damage equal to 4.75% of your Attack Power, 5% lower than Instant Poison.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Dissolvent Poison serves as the Physical counterpart of Instant Poison, the same was Corrosive Poison served as the Physical counterpart of Deadly Poison. Dissolvent Poison allows Rogues to perform well against poison resistant and immune targets even when they don't have the chance to stack up their Corrosive Poison and gives them more options against these enemies.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blind:</span> Debuff is now considered a Physical effect instead of a Poison.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: With the introduction of Insignias that remove all crowd control effects Blind has been struggling even more than before to stay on targets, so we're changing its effect type to Physical so that it isn't easily cleansable by potions and class specific spells.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Assasination</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Remorseless Attacks:</span> Now include Hemorrhage, Noxious Assault and Surprise Attack.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lethality:</span> Now include Noxious Assault and Surprise Attack.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Including all combo point generating abilities allows all specializations to work well with these early talents.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lethality:</span> Now includes Surprise Attack and Noxious Assault.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Corrosive Poison:</span> Attack Power scaling reduced by 5%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're slightly reducing the scaling on Corrosive Poison as the current damage difference between it and Deadly Poison are too marginal, causing the latter to be overlooked in most cases. We hope that this encourages rogues to use poisons appropriate to the situation instead of always using the Physical solution as the original poison variant now pulls ahead by a noticeable amount.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Throwing Weapon Specialization:</span> Moved from Row 4 to Row 3.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Relentless Strikes:</span> Now also increases Shadow of Death's damage dealt by 5% for each stack.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Taste For Blood:</span> Moved from Row 5 to Row 4. Now increases your Physical damage by 1/2/3% per combo point instead of increasing melee damage by 3/6/10% regardless of combo point and increases Rupture's duration by 2/4/6 sec. <br>
    This duration increase also affects Taste of Blood's duration.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Taste For Blood's damage now scales per combo point instead of being static as it being static often led to using Rupture at lower combo points as the base Rupture duration with minimal combo point usage was better to keep up its effect. We've also bumped up the amount of Physical damage it increases and it now increases Rupture's duration.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Envenom:</span> Moved from Row 7 to Row 5.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Vigor:</span> Removed the 8 second cooldown and reduced Energy gain from 5 to 2.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The cooldown on Vigor made the talent's energy throughput very weak, so we're removing it alongside a major reduction to the energy gain, but this still equals a big increase in energy gained from it.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    New Capstone (Row 7 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Noxious Assault</span><br>
    Strike with both weapons, dealing damage equal to 35% of your Attack Power plus 30/55/85/105 and applying poisons from both of your weapons. Awards 1 combo point. <br>
    (45 Energy Cost, Melee Range, Instant Cast, No Cooldown) <br>
    Ranks at level 40 (Talent), 48, 56, 60 (via Book)<br>
    Rank 1: 30 Extra Damage<br>
    Rank 2: 55 Extra Damage<br>
    Rank 3: 85 Extra Damage<br>
    Rank 4: 105 Extra Damage<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We've moved Envenom up two rows to instead replace it with a new capstone called Noxious Assault, a new combo point generating abilities that constantly applies your poisons and works well with all weapon types. Keep in mind that the energy cost is slightly higher than usual to compensate for Vigor generating energy with its poison applications.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Combat</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Swift Strikes:</span> Removed.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Expose Armor:</span> Moved from Row 3 Assasination to Row 1 Combat.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Moving Improved Expose Armor higher in the talent tree eases its requirements and makes it more accessible for most Rogue specializations to keep up its improved armor reduction.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blade Flurry:</span> Now baseline, refer to Baseline Changes for more information.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blade Rush:</span> Moved from Row 5 to Row 6 and reworked to the following: "Increases your melee attack speed by 2/5% and reduces the time between your Energy regeneration ticks by an amount equal to your Agility." <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Combat Expertise:</span> Moved from Row 6 to Row 5.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Subtlety</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Ghostly Strike:</span> Reworked to the following: "Your Ghostly Strike increases your movement speed by 5/10/15% and increases your party members' movement speed by 2/4/6% for 5 sec if they are within 30 yards. Additionally, reduces the Energy cost of your Ghostly Strike by 3/6/10."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Providing everyone increased dodge chance ended up not being impactful enough as in most cases the tank is the only person benefiting from this effect, so we're replacing it with a movement speed buff for both yourself and your party members and giving it an energy cost reduction for Ghostly Strike to make it more important on the rotation.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Sap:</span> Renamed to Blackjack, integrated Irritating Agent's functionality, increased damage reduction from 6% to 10% and added Sap as an ability that can apply it. This also means its talent point cost is reduced from 3 to 2 points. New talent description:<br>
    "Your Sap and Blind abilities reduce your target's damage dealt by 5/10% for 8 sec when their effect ends or fail to apply and gives you a 50/100% chance to return to stealth mode after using your Sap ability."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Irritating Agent struggled to find its place in the Subtlety Rogue's support arsenal due to Blind's steep cooldown, so we're slightly buffing its effect, combining it with Improved Sap and allowing Sap to also apply the effect to give it some usefulness in PvP too.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Smoke Bomb:</span> Updated icon.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Hemorrhage:</span> Energy cost reduced from 45 to 40.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bloody Mess:</span> Hemorrhage energy cost reduction reduced from 5/10 to 2/5.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Hemorrhage at its base version costs more energy than other combo point generators such as Sinister Strike which made it hard to use until you got the Bloody Mess talent, so we're reducing its base energy cost alongside the Bloody Mess energy cost reduction to equalize it with other alternatives.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Irritating Agent:</span> Removed and integrated into Improved Sap, now named Blackjack.<br>

    <hr>

    New Talent (Row 4 / 2 Points): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Cloaked in Shadows</span><br>
    Your Vanish grants you and your party members within 20 yards a shield for 20 sec, absorbing damage equal to 6/12% of your maximum health.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blinding Haze:</span> Now reduces Distract's energy cost by 5/10/15 and increased duration from 5 to 6 sec.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The energy cost on Distract ended up being too harsh to use while in active combat, often taking away from Tricks of the Trade uptime. For this reason the talent also reduces Distract's energy cost alongside a minor debuff duration increase.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Preparation:</span> Cooldown reduced from 10 to 7 minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Preparation ended up becoming an integral cooldown for Subtlety Rogues, allowing you to re-apply all support effects instantly which made the cooldown feel much harsher when its not available to use. The cooldown reduction also improves the cooldown uptime for PvP combat which Rogues often struggle with.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Dust of Disappearance:</span> Removed. <br>

    <hr>

    New Keystone (Row 5 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Shadow of Death</span><br>
    A finishing move that etches a sigil onto the target for 6 sec. The sigil accumulates damage equal to a percentage of all damage taken by the target in its duration, up to an amount equal to a percentage of your Attack Power, both increased for every combo point. When the maximum capacity is reached or the sigil expires, the stored damage is dealt to the target as Physical damage.<br>
    <br>
    1 point : 50% of Attack Power, 10% of Damage Accumulated<br>
    2 points: 100% of Attack Power, 20% of Damage Accumulated<br>
    3 points: 150% of Attack Power, 30% of Damage Accumulated <br>
    4 points: 200% of Attack Power, 40% of Damage Accumulated <br>
    5 points: 250% of Attack Power, 50% of Damage Accumulated<br>
    <br>
    (1 Minute Cooldown, 30 Energy Cost, Melee Range.)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're replacing Dust of Disappearance with a more active keystone talent, Shadow of Death allows you to rake in the benefits of your damage boosting support by accumulating a percentage of it in Shadow of Death's debuff effect, dealing that damage when it hits the capacity or expires. This talent naturally also synergizes with Preparation's cooldown reset.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Honor Among Thieves:</span> Now also triggers from your own critical strikes and its cooldown is reduced from 2 to 1.5 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: There was an inconsistency with Honor Among Thieves and Tricks of the Trade being worded the same way in the description but the former not benefiting the rogue itself, so we're allowing your own critical strikes to generate energy and reducing the cooldown on it.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mark for Death:</span> Now grants you and your party members attack power and spell power equal to a percentage of your melee attack power instead of a flat 15% damage increase, its duration is increased from 6 to 8 seconds and now cannot be blocked, dodged or parried. New talent description:<br>
    "A marking strike that deals 135% weapon damage and informs your party members of the target's vulnerabilities, increasing their Attack Power by 30% and Spell Power by 18% of your melee Attack Power for 8 sec. Mark For Death cannot be blocked, dodged, or parried. Awards 2 combo points."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Mark for Death ended up being much more rigid of a capstone than we've intended, primarily due to its effect not scaling with your gear. We're changing that by instead of giving a percentage damage increase it grants your party members spellpower and attack power equal to a percentage of your attack power which should allow your hard earned gear to matter more while supporting your group.</i></span><br>
