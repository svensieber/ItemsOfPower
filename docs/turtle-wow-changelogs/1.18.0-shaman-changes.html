    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Baseline Changes</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    Increased the range of all totems that affect friendly targets by 10 yards, increasing the range for most totems from 20 yards to 30 yards and increasing it from 30 yards to 40 yards for Tremor Totem.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Totemic Mastery often felt like a mandatory talent due to the 20 yard range being very constrictive in group play, so we're making its effect baseline while reworking Totemic Mastery, details below.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fire Totems</span> now inherit the Shaman's spell critical and spell hit chances.<br>

    <hr>

    New Spell: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Molten Blast</span><br>
    Burn the target with molten fire, dealing Fire damage, refreshing the duration of your Flame Shock effect and focusing your Searing Totem on that target.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">Damage and Mana Cost Values:</span><br>
    Rank 1 (Level 20): 61-73 Damage, 65 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 28): 96-119 Damage, 95 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 36): 136-155 Damage, 120 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 44): 185-204 Damage, 145 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 5 (Level 52): 238-268 Damage, 175 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 6 (Level 60/Book): 290-331 Damage, 210 Mana Cost<br>
    (2 Second Cast Time, Flat Mana Cost, 36 Yard Range, 57.14% Spellpower Scaling)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Molten Blast is a new spell that allows you to re-target your Searing Totem and refresh your Flame Shock effect without having to go into elemental shock casting range. This spell also has the benefit of being usable on enemies that are highly resistant or immune to Nature damage, allowing Elemental Shamans to stay relatively effective regardless of the type of enemy they face.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Windfury Totem:</span> Restored the animation that happens when you gain an extra attack.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rockbiter Weapon:</span> Threat bonus increased from 30% to 35%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Enhancement Tanks often struggle with threat generation, sometimes to the point some of them opt in to use a two-handed weapon instead of the conventional shield and one-handed weapon. For this reason we're doing some improvements to threat generation from Rockbiter Weapon and Spirit Armor (read more about that below), latter specifically targeting shield using tanks to keep up more closely in terms of threat to two-handed tanks and improving Totemic Alignment (also read more below) to help with multi-target threat generation.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Earthshaker Slam:</span> Updated icon and description.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Grounding Totem:</span> Now breaks after grounding a crowd control effect and its cooldown is increased from 15 seconds to 20 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Grounding Totem has been quite oppressive when used in PvP, feeling extra punishing in the cases where it redirects a crowd control effect and becomes able to redirect another spell if not broken after unlike damaging spells breaking it after its first spell redirect. For this reason the totem now breaks after it redirects a crowd control spell and has a slightly longer cooldown.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Chain Heal:</span> Healing power scaling reduced from 71.42% to 61.42%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The bouncing healing of Chain Heal has been dominant in the Restoration Shaman healing gameplay, even moreso in bigger group sizes. For this reason we're pulling slightly back on its scaling to give its other healing spells some room to shine.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Elemental</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Convection</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Concussion:</span> Now affects all offensive Fire, Frost and Nature spells instead of specific spells. This includes the new spells Earthquake and Molten Blast in addition to the previous ones.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reverberation:</span> Now requires 3 points instead of 5 points.<br>

    <hr>

    New Talent (Row 3 / 2 Points): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Molten Blast:</span><br>
    Refreshing Flame Shock with Molten Blast deals damage equal to 30/60% of the refreshed duration.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: With a new spell comes a new talent, Improved Molten Blast deals damage depending on how much time  and deals damage for a percentage of it, this makes it both good for when you have to constantly cast Molten Blast and for when you only use it to refresh Flame Shock before it runs out, making it equally powerful for both scenarios.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Fire Totems:</span> Now also increases your Searing Totem's attack speed by 10/20%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This talent was lacking in single target performance, often leaving it untouched for most people and felt odd that it included all the direct damaging Fire totems except for Searing Totem, so we're now including it in the family.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Call of Flame:</span> Now also increases Flame Shock's range by 3/6/10 yards.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This range increase was originally part of Flame Guidance, which has been moved here as that talent has been replaced.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Electrify:</span> Renamed to "Elemental Fury", now requires 2 points instead of 1 point and does the following: "Increases the damage done by your Fire and Nature spells by 5/10% and increases the critical strike damage bonus of your Searing, Magma, and Fire Nova Totems and your Fire, Frost, and Nature spells by 50/100%."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We originally staggered the critical strike damage bonus gain to mitigate the overall burstiness Elemental Shaman has in PvP. Since we've reworked the functionality of Elemental Mastery and we're looking at PvP burst in general this isn't needed anymore so we're returning its original behavior alongside the damage boost it had with Electrify.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Elemental Mastery:</span> Moved from Row 7 to Row 5, functionality reworked: "Increase your Fire, Frost and Nature damage by 15% and reduce the mana cost of your offensive spells by 20% for 10 sec."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're reworking Elemental Mastery to deal its overall damage over a longer period of time instead of in one giant burst. This overall reduces burstiness but should equal a net gain in sustained damage.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    New Capstone (Row 7 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Earthquake</span><br>
    "Break the earth below the target, dealing Nature damage and dealing additional damage equal to 35% of the initial damage to targets within 10 yards leaving a patch of broken earth that slows enemies inside it by 15%. After 4 seconds, the broken earth shakes with an aftershock, dealing damage equal to 30% of the initial damage to all enemies inside it."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">Damage and Mana Cost Values:</span><br>
    Rank 1 (Level 40): 227 to 252 Damage, 225 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 50): 343 to 386 Damage, 335 Mana Cost<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 60): 510 to 550 Damage, 440 Mana Cost<br>
    (2.5 Second Cast Time, 60% Spellpower Coefficient, 36 Yard Range, 20 Second Cooldown)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Earthquake is the new capstone that replaces Elemental Mastery, serving as a testament to a true shaman's power over the elements. This spell is designed to be powerful in both single and multi-target situations while offering counterplay in PvP by allowing the enemy to escape from the broken earth before the aftershock occurs.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>Enhancement</b></span></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Totemic Alignment:</span> Threat transfer increased from 30/60% to 45/90%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Calming Winds:</span> Threat reduction is now disabled while you have Rockbiter Weapon active. <br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're giving Calming Winds the same effect we've given to Vengeance, disabling the threat reduction when using a threat increasing effect.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spirit Armor:</span> Now also increases your threat generation by 5/10% while you're wearing a shield. <br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Enhancing Totems:</span> Effect increase on Strength of Earth and Grace of Air Totems increased from 8/15% to 12/25%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The power gained from this talent hasn't quite matched the talent position it currently has so we're improving how much they power up your stat increasing totems.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Stormstrike:</span> Nature damage bonus increased from 20% to 25%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're slightly buffing Stormstrike's bonus effect to move Earth Shock higher in priority for Enhancement's damage dealing rotation.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Weapon Mastery:</span> Renamed to “Element's Grace” and now also increases the critical strike chance of your instant-cast spells by 2/4/6/8/10%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: While elemental shocks have always been a big part of Enhancement's rotation, their own specialization tree lacked talents that directly improve on them, we're changing that by including shocks in the original Weapon Mastery talent.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Healing Way:</span> Now has a 33/66/100% chance to be applied by Lesser Healing Wave and the effect also increases Lesser Healing Wave's healing.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Healing Wave and Lesser Healing Wave quite struggle compared to Chain Heal in terms of throughput, so we're giving them some love alongside the Chain Heal scaling nerf to incentivize their usage, with a cast time reduction buff on Improved Healing Wave and the inclusion of Lesser Healing Wave in Healing Way, both allowing it to benefit from the effect and the shorter cast time of Lesser Healing Wave making it faster to gain stacks of Healing Way on the target.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Totemic Mastery:</span> Reworked: “Increase the duration of your totems that affect friendly targets by 20% and the amount of mana refunded by Totemic Recall by an additional 15%.”<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're changing the effect of Totemic Mastery now that we've made the 30 yard range totems baseline, it now gives your non-damaging totems a longer duration and returns more mana when they're returned early with Totemic Recall.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Tidal Surge:</span> Effect redone: “After healing a target affected by your Healing Way effect, you have a 15/30% chance to regain mana equal to 15% of the base cost of the spell.”<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This talent was more complicated than it needed to be, so we're simplifying it while keeping its power mostly the same.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spirit Link:</span> Now an instant cast, casting and linking range increased from 15 yards to 35 yards, duration reduced from 30 seconds to 20 seconds and cooldown increased from 6 minutes to 10 minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Initially Spirit Link was designed as a gotcha in niche situations that the player could directly influence. However, the range and cast time were too restrictive to create these situations and see much play so we are relaxing some of its restrictions while modifying the duration and cooldown.</i></span><br>
