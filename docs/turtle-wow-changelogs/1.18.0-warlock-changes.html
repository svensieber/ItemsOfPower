    <hr>

    Warlocks now learn <span style="color:#ffbf40">Pet Command: Take Position</span> when they learn Summon Imp. This command allows you to select a location to send your pet to, cancelled by clicking Follow again. Take Position obeys line of sight rules, meaning pets cannot be sent to locations you can’t see.<br>
    This spell allows Warlocks to more accurately position their demons, putting them out of danger’s way and adjusting their location behind bosses to avoid pets getting parried.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Drain Soul:</span> Changed large part of the mana cost to be dynamic:<br>
    Rank 1 (Level 10): 72 Mana -&gt; 15 Initial + 10 Every Second (75 Total over 6 Seconds)<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 24): 188 Mana -&gt; 35 Initial + 25 Every Second (185 Total over 6 Seconds)<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 38): 324 Mana -&gt; 70 Initial + 40 Every Second (310 Total over 6 Seconds)<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 52): 432 Mana -&gt; 100 Initial + 55 Every Second (430 Total over 6 Seconds)<br>
    Rank 5 (Level 60): 524 Mana -&gt; 135 Initial + 65 Every Second (525 Total over 6 Seconds)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Used for both farming Soul Shards and as a filler ability of Affliction, having such high cost for sometimes only 1 or 2 seconds of uptime was unnecessarily punishing.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Health Funnel and Mana Funnel:</span> Increased range from 20 yards to 30 yards.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Stones - Firestone, Felstone and Wrathstone:</span> Now usable while in combat.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Doomguard:</span> Can no longer use Rend. Now has the ability "Infernal Blade":<br>
    "For the next 12 sec, weapon attacks deal 30% additional Fire damage which engulfs the target in flames dealing 250 Fire damage over 5 sec. Stacks up to 3 times."<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Spellstone:</span> No longer a passive buff, instead its an active item that when used removes all Magic effects from the casters and grants them a shield that absorbs magic damage equal to the caster's level times 12 for 30 seconds. Shares a cooldown with Healthstones.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're returning this signature spell back to its vanilla state with slight adjustments and as a consumable instead of off-hand, adding a strategic decision.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rain of Fire:</span> Now deals damage every 1 second instead of 2 seconds. Overall damage stays the same.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Fire:</span> Spellpower coefficient reduced from 125% to 114%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're normalizing the scaling to make up for the increase of Improved Soul Fire's power, keeping PvP burst potential in check while helping out PvE Destruction builds.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Affliction</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Debilitating Curses:</span> Renamed to "Improved Curse of Weakness" and no longer increases Curse of Exhaustion's slow.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fel Concentration:</span> Now requires 2 points instead of 5 points and now affects all Affliction spells. This means that it can also prevent pushback while casting Fear and Howl of Terror.<br>

    <hr>

    New Talent (Row 3 / 3 Points): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Sinister Pursuit</span><br>
    "Increase the movement speed of your demons by 5/10/15% for 3 seconds after they attack a target affected by Affliction effects."<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Curse of Exhaustion:</span> Movement speed reduction reduced from 30% to 10%.<br>

    <hr>

    New Talent (Row 5 / 2 Points): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Curse of Exhaustion</span><br>
    “Increases the speed reduction of your Curse of Exhaustion by 15/30%.”<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Curse of Exhaustion was too easily accessible by other specializations which provided them with oppressive levels of control. We're now making its full power only accessible to Affliction warlocks.</i></span><br>

    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Demonology</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Soul Entrapment:</span> Damage increase while you have no pet increased from 1/2/3% to 2/4/6%.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Sacrifice:</span> Benefits gained from sacrificing demons changed:<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Imp:</span> 6% Fire Damage -&gt; 4% Spell Damage<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Voidwalker:</span> Unchanged.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Succubus:</span> 6% Shadow Damage -&gt; -10% Threat Generation<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Felhunter:</span> 2% Total Mana Regeneration every 4 seconds -&gt; 3% Total Mana Regeneration every 4 seconds<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Power Overwhelming:</span> Now removes all crowd control from your demon on activation and costs 40% base health instead of maximum health.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're adding versatility and tactical choices to make up for the disadvantages that come with relying on your pet as much as Demonology does. Also the spell will now reward giving demons more stamina rather than punish it.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Demonic Precision:</span> Percentage of spell critical and hit chance transferred reduced from 33/66/100% to 30/60/90% but now grants your demon 1/2/3% spell hit, spell critical chance, physical hit and physical critical chance baseline.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We're shifting some power to baseline values, so this talent is worthwhile taking for the levelers.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Demonologist:</span> Removed secondary effects added to demons previously and removed greater demon specific bonuses, instead all greater demons now gain the same benefit and drawback. The new effects are the following:<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Imp:</span> 3/6/9/12/15% reduced spell costs.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Voidwalker:</span> 2/4/6/8/10% reduced physical damage taken.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Succubus:</span> 2/4/6/8/10% increased all damage done.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Felhunter:</span> 0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1 increased all resistances per level.<br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Greater Demons:</span> 2/4/6/8/10% increased spell critical chance and 8/16/24/32/40% reduced healing taken.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The removed secondary effects failed to sufficiently improve gameplay, sometimes even hindering it. At the same time, we're unifying Greater demon effects, including the Doomguard.</i></span><br>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Shadow Bolt:</span> Renamed to "Shadow Vulnerability" and can now be applied by Drain Soul by its damage ticks with the same chance as Shadow Bolt.<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Destructive Reach:</span> Now also increases the radius of Hellfire.<br>

    <hr>
