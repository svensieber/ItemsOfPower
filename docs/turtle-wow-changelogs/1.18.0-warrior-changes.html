    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Execute:</span> Removed cooldown.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: When we introduced a cooldown on Execute in Class Changes 2, our goal was to further distinguish Fury and Arms execute phases. However, the change fell flat in practice and forced most Arms players to spec into the Fury tree simply to avoid the restriction. We’re reverting this entirely, restoring the high-tempo feel of Warrior finishers while reshaping the Arms-specific execute flow through talents instead.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Arms</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Counterattack:</span> Removed.<br>

    <hr>

    New Keystone (Row 3 / 1 Point): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Master Strike</span><br>
    "Perform a skillful attack with a weapon, dealing 35% weapon damage and causing an additional effect depending on your main hand weapon. <br>
    Mace - Disorient the target for 3 sec. Any damage caused will remove the effect.<br>
    Sword - Disarm the target for 3 sec.<br>
    Axe - Immobilize the target for 4 sec.<br>
    Polearm - Deal an additional 100% weapon damage if target is mounted, and dismounts them.<br>
    Fist Weapon - Knock down the target for 2 sec.<br>
    Staff - Increases your chance to parry by 25% for 10 sec.<br>
    Dagger - Silence the target for 3 sec."<br>
    (20 Rage Cost, 30 Second Cooldown, Melee Range)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Counterattack had potential, but the conditions to trigger it were too niche. Master Strike replaces it as a flexible, weapon-dependent control ability that brings much-needed crowd control options for Warriors—especially in PvP. Combined with Master of Arms, this talent encourages tactical weapon swaps and deepens the fantasy of Arms as a battlefield tactician.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Mortal Strike:</span> Damage increased for all ranks.<br>
    Rank 1 (Level 40): 105% -&gt; 115% Weapon Damage<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 48): 110% -&gt; 120% Weapon Damage<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 54): 115% -&gt; 125% Weapon Damage<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 60): 120% -&gt; 130% Weapon Damage<br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Slam:</span> Damage increased for all ranks but Rank 1.<br>
    Rank 2 (Level 24): 60% -&gt; 65% Weapon Damage<br>
    Rank 3 (Level 34): 70% -&gt; 80% Weapon Damage<br>
    Rank 4 (Level 44): 80% -&gt; 90% Weapon Damage<br>
    Rank 5 (Level 54): 90% -&gt; 100% Weapon Damage<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We’re giving a baseline damage bump to key rotational abilities, particularly to help in PvP where burst windows are short and reactive play is critical. These boosts also compensate for the changes to Precision Cut, ensuring Arms still has a satisfying damage curve in both PvE and PvP.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Precision Cut:</span> Reworked: "Increases the base damage done by Execute by 15/30/45%."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Please note that this affects the base damage, where before the extra rage was modified. With this new effect also replacing the rage refund feature that allowed for repeatedly pressing execute, this should instead shift ideal play to incentivize spending a swing's generated rage with other abiltiies, before spending the remaining on Execute. We may continue making adjustments specifically to this talent, to ensure this gameplay model remains fun.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    Swapped talent positions of <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Disciplines</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Slam</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This backend reordering prevents certain talent stacking paths and maintains balance between newly modified Flurry and Improved Slam. It won’t affect current standard builds.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%"><span style="color:#8dc63f"><b>Fury</b></span></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Reckless Execute:</span> Renamed back to "Improved Execute" and now reduces Execute's rage cost by 2/5 like before.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This change alongside the Execute cooldown removal consitute a full reversion of Execute's behavior back to Vanilla</i></span>
    <hr>

    Swapped talent positions of <span style="color:#ffbf40">Battlefield Mobility</span> and <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Execute</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Battlefield Mobility:</span> Now additionally reduces Charge's cooldown by 2/4 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This small change should make this rarely picked talent a more viable option.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Flurry:</span> Now additionaly reduces the cast time of Slam.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We hope this change breathes new life into Two-Handed Fury, giving Slam-based rotations a smoother rhythm and helping it carve out a niche from the dual-wield variant. </i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Bloodthirst:</span> Movement speed increase increased from 5% to 10%.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The previous speed boost was too small to feel impactful. With this change, Bloodthirst now provides a more noticeable and useful passive bonus during combat.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Blood Drinker:</span> Reworked to the following: "While under the effect of Enrage, Death Wish or Recklessness, your attack and abilities heal you for 1/1.5/2% of you maximum health."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Previously, Blood Drinker was far too conditional to be reliable. This rework makes the talent much more consistent and gives Fury Warriors greatly improved self-sustain, especially in PvP and solo play.</i></span><br>

    <hr>

    New Talent (Row 6 / 2 Points): <span style="color:#ffbf40">Improved Berserker Rage</span><br>
    "Berserker Rage will generate 5/10 rage and has a 50/100% chance to free you from all movement impairing effects upon activation."<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This freedom effect only works once on the moment of activation, but with this ability on a 30 second cooldown and the buff to Blood Drinker, we hope to see that this opens up a niche for building Fury for PvP.</i></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Protection</span></b></span><br>

    <hr>

    <span style="color:#ffbf40">Concussive Blow:</span> No longer costs Rage and instead generates 10 Rage instantly when cast.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Concussive Blow often felt awkward to use as an opener due to its Rage cost. By making it generate Rage instead, we’re improving its utility, especially in the early moments of a pull when Rage is scarce. We’ll continue monitoring this ability and may further refine it if needed.</i></span>
