  <br>
  Ranged variant of Hunter has been one of the least changed classes in Class Changes 2 and has fallen behind other
  damage dealers and melee Hunter not only in raw DPS, but also in terms of gameplay.<br>
  Ranged Hunter is extremely timing-dependent and offers little reactivity in its rotation. In this patch, we are
  reviewing the Hunter kit as a whole to ensure more abilities are useful and impactful, and reworking the talent trees
  to make them more engaging in endgame content.<br>

  New Spell: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Aspect of the Viper</span> - Learned at Level 56.<br>
  <br>
  "The hunter takes on the aspect of the viper, regenerating 5% of maximum mana every 5 second. Only one Aspect can be
  active at a time."<br>
  <br>
  (No Mana Cost)<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Hunter is a class that cannot reliably regain mana without proper set bonuses and can be quite mana-hungry. To offset this, we are adding a passive way to regain mana with the small drawback of occupying an Aspect slot.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Trueshot Aura:</span> Now baseline, learned at Level 40.<br>
  <br>
  "Increases the attack power of party members within 45 yards by 3%, plus an additional 30."<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Trueshot Aura was a design-limiting ability and an uninteresting capstone. For that reason, we are making it baseline for all Hunters in a slightly toned-down version.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Steady Shot:</span> Now baseline, learned at Level 20.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Steady Shot has been a must-have ability for all ranged Hunters, while Aimed Shot was rendered almost useless by its existence. We believe such a core ability should be part of the baseline kit, so we are returning Steady Shot as one.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Volley:</span> Has seen various changes.<br>
  - Now a 3 second cast instead of a continuous channeled ability.<br>
  - Mana Costs reduced:<br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rank 1 (Level 40):</span> From 350 to 210<br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rank 2 (Level 50):</span> From 420 to 270<br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rank 3 (Level 60):</span> From 490 to 330<br>
  - Now has Attack Power scaling:<br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rank 1 (Level 40):</span> 4% Attack Power Scaling<br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rank 2 (Level 50):</span> 5% Attack Power Scaling<br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Rank 3 (Level 60):</span> 6% Attack Power Scaling<br>
  Any spell power scaling remains unchanged.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Volley has always been interesting in concept but too weak to justify use in practice. Due to its channeled nature, its damage would have had to be increased to unreasonable levels to be viable. We are therefore converting it into a casted ability that does not require the Hunter to stop performing other actions for 10 seconds to reach its full potential.</i></span><br>

  damage.<br>

  damage.<br>

  Cast time reduced from 3 seconds to 2 seconds, Cooldown increased from 6 seconds to 26 seconds.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Due to its long cast time, Aimed Shot struggled to find a place in the Hunter rotation. We are reducing its cast time and adding several Aimed Shot–centric talents to make it a cooldown worth pressing for Marksmanship.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  New Keystone: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Experimental Ammunition</span> (5th Row)<br>
  <br>
  "Your <span style="color:#ffbf40">Aimed Shot</span> deals an additional 5% of its damage as Fire, Arcane or Nature
  damage and grants you a benefit depending on the element:<br>
  <br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Fire Ammunition:</span> Your next Multi-Shot hits explode for 20% ranged weapon damage in
  5 yard radius.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Ammunition:</span> Your next Arcane Shot deals 100% increased damage and weakens
  target's resistance to magic, increasing magic damage taken by 3% for 6 seconds.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Nature Ammunition:</span> Your next Serpent Sting deals 100% increased damage and applies
  a corrosive poison that reduces target's armor by 4 per level (240 at Level 60) for 15 seconds."<br>
  <br>
  These effects last 1 minute and cycle between each other in the order of Fire, Arcane and Nature.<br>
  Only one type of ammunition can be active at a time.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The goal of this talent is to give unique, thematic effects to existing abilities that reinforce their roles, while encouraging the use of Aimed Shot and lesser-used Hunter abilities in combination with it.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  New Capstone Talent: <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lock and Load</span> (1 rank, 7th row)<br>
  "Your <span style="color:#ffbf40">Steady Shot</span>, <span style="color:#ffbf40">Aimed Shot</span> and <span
      style="color:#ffbf40">Arcane Shot</span> critical strikes have a chance to reset the cooldown of <span
      style="color:#ffbf40">Aimed Shot</span> and trigger Lock and Load. Lasts 10 seconds or until you cast <span
      style="color:#ffbf40">Aimed Shot</span>.<br>
  <br>
  Lock and Load reduces the cast time of <span style="color:#ffbf40">Aimed Shot</span> by 1 second and causes your <span
      style="color:#ffbf40">Aimed Shot</span> to damage all enemies in between you and the target."<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: This capstone is intended to make the rotation more interactive through procs, improve endgame scaling, and reduce the impact of slight auto-shot delays by shifting more power into active abilities.</i></span><br>

  <span style="color:#8dc63f"><b><span style="font-size:115%;line-height:116%">Beast Mastery</span></b></span><br>
  <br>
  In the last patch, we reworked Beast Mastery, but the changes did not hit the mark.<br>
  The specialization played awkwardly, so we are redesigning it again with a focus on smoother gameplay and preservation
  of core Beast Mastery mechanics.<br>
  <br>

  <hr>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Endurance Training:</span> Health increase buffed from 1/2/3/4/5% to 2/4/6/8/10%.<br>

  (1.5 Minute Cooldown, 12% Base Mana Cost, No Global Cooldown)<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Bestial Wrath has been one of the most requested abilities to return. We agree it is iconic, so we are restoring it with an additonal method of activating its effect for a limited duration.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Kill Command:</span> Moved to be the Capstone talent and reworked:<br>
  "Give the command to kill, causing your pet to instantly attack for 50% of its attack power. Can only be used after
  the Hunter lands a critical strike on the target."<br>
  <br>
  (8 Second Cooldown, 5% Base Mana Cost, 45 Yard Range, No Global Cooldown)<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Our previous version of Kill Command was underpowered and required too much setup. This new version, inspired by The Burning Crusade, should provide familiar and beloved gameplay while being attack speed–agnostic.</i></span><br>

  While you have no pet under your control, all damage dealt is increased by 3/6%.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Pet management is an important part of Hunter gameplay, but for some players it can be overwhelming. This talent allows Hunters to raid and run dungeons without managing a pet, even though optimal play with a pet will still yield slightly higher DPS.</i></span><br>

  <hr>
  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Surefooted:</span> Now increases hit chance by an additional 1/2/3% while dual
  wielding.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: Dual Wield Hunter has struggled to reach hit cap, and this change should help players who enjoy that playstyle.</i></span><br>

  <span style="color:#ffbf40">Lacerate:</span> Damage increased from 35% to 40% of melee Attack Power, extra damage from
  the sides increased from 10% to 15%. No longer makes the bleed tick faster when struck from the sides.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The lack of throughput caused Lacerate to fall into the wayside in the hierarchy of ability priorities, so we're giving it an increase in damage a bigger incentive to use it from the sides.

  barrier.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: The addition of the Frost damage increase while Ice Barrier is active has been successful in making it a desired capstone outside of instances you expect to be attacked or damaged semi-frequently but that same damage now feels punishing when it breaks the barrier and makes you lose that throughput power. <br>
For this reason we've moved a big chunk of the damage increase to be on the Ice Barrier cast, allowing it to stay as a part of the rotation without being as punishing as it was before when its lost to area of effect damage especially in group content.</i></span><br>

  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: We've initially pulled down on the healing values of Priest healing spells with the tradeoff of increasing the power of Spiritual Healing in the Holy talent tree to offset this power, encouraging priests that want to heal to specialize into it and less so towards the Discipline support elements.<br>
This inadvertently led to some ranks barely having any number difference between pre-level 30 and post-level 30 ranks as the healing reduction change was only applied to healing spells level 30 or higher. This also caused healing without specializing into Holy much harder while leveling after level 30, so we've looked into these healing spells to increase the base healing values for a middle ground between original and current healing numbers.<br>
We hope these changes mend these problems and make healing without specializing smoother in leveling, don't mind the pun.</i></span><br>

  <span style="opacity:0.7"><i>Developer Comment: When designing a class, we often look for ways to blend flavor with function. While this frequently involves fitting a square peg into a triangular slot, Elemental is particularly well suited to aligning form and function when enough creativity is applied. Proper spell pushback resistance has long been missing from Elemental, as Eye of the Storm saw little use in either PvP or PvE: in the former, critical hits occurred infrequently enough that the talent was often skipped, while in the latter, critical hits were almost always fatal regardless. As a result, we’ve decided to retire the talent in favor of a solution that better serves its intended purpose, while also reinforcing Elemental’s thematic identity. With this change, the Elemental tree now answers the call of Earth, Flame, and Thunder—now if only we could find a way to introduce the Call of Wind in time for the 21st of September.<br>
<br>
Although we generally view Elemental Shields as a concept better suited to Enhancement gameplay, and Water Shield as central to Restoration’s mana sustain, we are happy to give Earth Shield a place within the Elemental specialization. This allows Elemental shamans to make more meaningful use of the Earth element beyond its capstone talent. Note that the bonus from Earth’s Poise, the buff granted by this talent, stacks additively with other sources of spell pushback reduction.<br>
<br>
The changes to Earthquake are intended to elevate the spell into a capstone worthy not just in form, but in function. While the adjustments themselves are straightforward, our goal is to encourage shamans to use the spell in a wider range of scenarios, addressing the fact that its original damage values often felt underwhelming.</i></span><br>
